       "   'thank you very much for the information it seems the existing standards serve their purpose well but kerry did mention an interesting point both these networks have low data rate and are insensitive to latency so maybe for the networks or applications where low latency is a critical requirement in addition to the bandwidth efficiency we could find such contextless scheme more compelling this is very helpful discussion thanks a lot',\n",
       "   'during the presentation of the nsa document at the last meeting erik did raise the question on whether nsa is in the scope of the lo charter which does not include routing the question is meaningful since the document uses the term routing in it however we the authors believe the document belongs here nsa is basically an addressing technology that enables nearly stateless forwarding aka does not need routing mechanism on top despite the very specific deployability scope it might happens that some temporary topology changes arise to cope with this situation what is needed is to install temporary forwarding rules so to guarantee connectivity at the price of some limited state there is no actual routing exchange meaning there is no explicit routing messages of any type floating around may be the term routing is a bit misleading in such scenario and we will replace it with forwarding rule in the next revision of the document and further clarify it does this address the concern about nsa in scope of lo',\n",

       "   'thank you for the question in our architecture the edge network follows a strict hierarchical tree structure the root represents the entire edge network each tree node represents a lower level network and each branch represents a section of prefix thus while we allow each lower level network to have multiple gateway routers aka lgr they must own and advertise one same subnet prefix only if we guarantee this we can safely prune the destination address prefix off from a packet when it enters into this lower level network or augment the source address with this prefix when a packet exits this lower level network in general we assume one edge network is totally under a single operator if not then each operator should own a separate lower level network in your scenario node a and b should be in two different lower level networks and they can communicate using the approaches we laid out hopefully i understand your question correctly if not please feel free to elaborate it thanks',\n",
       "   'your idea might be interesting but i did not get it still trying to absorb it in the context of lo but i think it conflicts with other exsiting lo standards just few comments is it possible if you make a scenario in the next draft because you did not answer about the ownership of border router can you check how pios are shared in llns and how your idea deal with them note pios not a single pio how you can define the scalability and flexibility in context of a multiple operators i think rfc is far more simple and flexible you are just targeting the common prefix problem which is bearable but putting alot of complexity in the lln by making lgrs and new addressing scheme a suggestion read lowpannd and rpl may be after reading you can analyze conflicts',\n",

       "   'that does not necessarily mean the statement in the rfc is clear let us start with the proposed wording a hop limit value of is often used to verify that a communication occurs over a single hop i believe a sender would set a value of to ensure a packet only travels over a single hop a receiver might use the comparison value of to verify a received packet has not been routed however the preceding sentence in rfc suggests that is also a common value for outbound traffic in the event a value of might indicate the packet has not been routed but it might also indicate the packet traveled hops before reaching the receiver so seems the only reliable comparison value why would a receiver need to know this',\n",
       "   'i remember filing this erratum and at the time someone pointed out how the hoplimit is used etc as kerry describes i am surprised that the erratum has not been closed previously the flagged statement in the rfc is not clear if one is not steeped in lowpan networking though it is not necessary to understand and apply the rfc',\n",

       "   'rfc lpwan overview introduces the terms dev and app rfc the base schc specification reuses and expands a little bit the definition of these terms dev refers to a constrained device sensor actuator etc whereas app refers to a networkside less constrained element that is a communication endpoint for devs these terms dev app are exploited in rfc as an optimization for schc header compression of ipv addresses and udp ports in order to allow the same rule to be used for compressiondecompression cd for both directions however if we try to use schc in a different scenario the same model may not always be a good fit for example in draftgomezloschcdot we are defining how schc can be used for cd in networks if the network follows the star topology and the constrained devices communicate with some networkside element the terms dev and app apply as well as in the original lpwan context however if we consider a mesh network where any two peers may be the communicating endpoints it is less clear what role would correspond to a specific device by nature all the constrained devices could be dev in such a peertopeer scenario if we want to reuse the dev and app terms perhaps the only way to do so might be to provide additional context to each device indicating what role corresponds to device a when talking to device b and when talking to any other device this seems quite complex and opens some further another approach is using the position of ipv addresses or udp ports use source and destination fields in packet headers for cd in this case there is no need to be limited by the dev and app terms for cd in this case however one rule is needed for each direction another detail is that the uplink and downlink terms are defined in rfc as a function of dev and app therefore if dev and app are not applicable uplinkdownlink are not applicable either or they may have a local meaning only for each specific pair of should we then need to consider other terms like just transmit and receive this is relevant for cd of coap header what are your thoughts lpwan chairs since this topic may be related with the lpwan architecture effort i would be happy to discuss the topic with some slides in the next interim next tuesday if there is room in the agenda',\n",

derived interface id these two bits must not be used to generate the panid for ieee and itut or nid for ieee in other words the panid or nid must always be chosen so that these bits are zeros is this a new requirement on the panidnid not already imposed by the underlying specifications if so it seems that it presents a limitation on the ability of already deployed plc networks to adopt this ipv adaptation layer for privacy reasons the iid derived from the mac address should only be used for linklocal address configuration a plc host should use the iid derived from the linklayer short address to configure the ipv address used for communication with the public network otherwise the hosts mac address is exposed as per rfc when short addresses are used on plc links a shared secret key or version number from the authoritative border router option rfc can be used to improve the entropy of the hash input thus the generated iid can be spread out to the full range of the iid address space while stateless address compression is still allowed the phrasing derived from is a little ambiguous to me since it can encompass procedures ranging from the flip the ul bit and append plc iid to the networks prefix procedure to rfc style stable but opaque iids that incorporate the mac address into the pseudorandom functions inputs given the followup text about hosts mac address is exposed it feels like this is implying more of the former procedure wouldnt the latter type of procedure be preferred though as implied by the hash input in the last sentence in particular the last sentence seems to imply that there is always a hash input which is at odds with the former interpretation that i present for derived from im not confident that i understand the intent of this paragraph section in order to avoid the possibility of duplicated ipv addresses the value of the nid must be chosen so that the th and th bits of the first byte of the nid are both zero as above its not clear that the nid is something that this adaptation layer can assert control over section in order to avoid the possibility of duplicated ipv addresses the value of the pan id must be chosen so that the th and th bits of the first byte of the pan id are both zero likewise section the compression of ipv datagrams within plc mac frames refers to rfc which updates rfc header compression as defined in rfc which specifies the compression format for ipv datagrams on top of ieee is the basis for ipv header compression in plc for situations when plc mac mtu cannot support the octet ipv packet headers must be compressed according to rfc encoding formats rfc refers to both a dispatch value and the lowpaniphc header compression encoding i strongly suggest clarifying whether both or just lowpaniphc is used for ieee and the ip header compression follows the instruction in rfc however additional adaptation must be considered for ieee since it has a short address of bits instead of bits the only modification is the semantics of the source address mode when set as in the section of rfc which is illustrated as following is there anything useful to say about how carrying vs bits affects byte alignment of the overal compressed message a quick survey of rfc finds many items that retain byte alignment and i didnt actually find anything that left the encoded bit stream in a nonaligned state sam source address mode i see that rfc also has procedures for destination address mode dam including a scenario that involves conveying a bit address component do we need to treat that dam analogously to how we treat the sam here this might also handle the byte alignment question from my previous section in ieee and ieee the mac layer supports payloads as big as octets and octets respectively however when the channel condition is noisy it is possible to configure smaller mtu at the mac layer if the configured mtu is smaller than octects the fragmentation and reassembly defined in rfc must be used does this imply that implementing the ipv adaptation layer fragmentationreassembly logic is mandatory for implementations of ipv over ieee and since the implementation might be configured in a way that requires that support please be clear about what is required of implementations and in what circumstances also as above please be clear about the interaction with the rfc dispatch layer section node pan devices are typically plc meters and sensors the panc also serves as the routing registrar for proxy registration and dad procedures making use of the updated registration procedures in rfc ipv over plc networks are built as tree mesh or star if the panc always serves as the routing registrar and thus the rfc procedures are always used why do we allow for both rfc and dad procedures up in section we should probably incorporate by reference the security considerations of the documents whose technologies we are adopting one might hope that it goes without saying but its nonetheless probably worth noting that the panc being in a position to observe all traffic is necessarily a trusted entity due to the high accessibility of power grid plc might be susceptible to eavesdropping within its communication coverage one apartment tenant may have the chance to monitor the other smart meters in the same apartment building thus link layer security mechanisms are designed in the plc technologies mentioned in this document key management for these security mechanisms will of course be quite important iot devices are notoriously vulnerable to physical attacks and key extraction so there may be something useful to say about the importance of key management and what is exposed if the key material available to a single device is compromised its quite hard to make an evaluation of the actual security properties provided by the linklayer mechanisms without access to the actual specification documents for those technologies id actually seriously consider adding another clause that and additional endtoend security services can be used for sensitive traffic and as additional protection against compromised plc nodes or something in that general vein additionally its often the case that the linklayer security mechanisms involve groupshared symmetric keys so that a compromise of even a single device puts the entire network or a large chunk of the network at risk if this is the case for the plc link layers it seems imperative to mention that risk in this document malicious plc devices could paralyze the whole network via dos attacks keep joining and leaving the network frequently or multicast routing messages containing fake metrics a device may is there potential for interfering withcorrupting legitimate traffic as a dos vector as well illegal users mutual authentication of network and new device can be conducted during the onboarding process of the new device methods include protocols such as rfc exchanging preinstalled certificates over dtls which uses preshared keys and which uses idevid and masa service it is also possible to use eap methods such as via transports like pana rfc no specific mechanism is specified by this document as an appropriate mechanism will depend upon deployment circumstances would sztp rfc be applicable for these scenarios also i would recognize brski more than idevid and a masa service though i dont know if i am the right population to be sampling for readibility data scanning schemes such as limited lease period in dhcpv rfc cryptographically generated addresses cgas rfc privacy extensions rfc hashbased addresses hbas rfc or semantically opaque addresses rfc should be considered to enhance the iid privacy should be considered is a fairly weak guidance i would think that should be used would be more consistent with the ietf consensus position while still leaving ample space for other behaviors section i would consider classifying rfc as normative nits meters for electricity the inherent advantage of existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of plc deployments and moreover a wide variety of accessible devices raises the potential demand of ipv for future applications this advantage typically implies a comparison with some other thing or things as measured on a particular axis or axes while one might presume that this refers to the advantages of using existing wires over new wires in terms of cost and ease of deployment its probably worth stating it more clearly section century with the advantage of existing power grid power line communication plc is a good candidate for supporting various service scenarios such as in houses and offices in trains and as above what is the advantage of existing power grid section panc pan coordinator a coordinator which also acts as the primary controller of a pan pan is not marked as wellknown at in fact is not even defined there and thus should get its own expansion section information in the replied neighbor advertisements from the lr if dhcpv is used to assign addresses or the ipv address is derived from unique long or short link layer address duplicate address detection dad must not be utilized otherwise the dad must be performed at the lbr as per rfc or proxied by the routing registrar as per rfc the registration status is feedbacked via the dac or edac message from the lbr and the neighbor advertisement na from the lr a few words on how the lrlbr must know whether or is in use on the network and thus there is no ambiguity about which entity is performing dad might be helpful section bits the first bits of the address are value of the first bits is the linklocal prefix padded with spaces after the sentence break section rfc ipv over plc networks are built as tree mesh or star according to the use cases generally each plc network has one i think as a tree mesh or star topology the size of plc networks a simple use case is the smart home scenario where the onoff state of air conditioning is controlled by the state of home lights onoff and doors openclose aodvrpl almost all the other examples in the document refer to plc meters or sensors mostly meters so the smart home scenario sticks out as being rather different when only mentioned in passing like this i dont question the conclusion but the overall writing style of the document might be improved if we introduced this scenario earlier on so that it was a more continual theme enables direct pan device to pan device communication without being obliged to transmit frames through the panc which is a requirement often cited for ami infrastructure the only earlier mention of aodvrpl was in we might consider repeating the reference here in case the reader missed it the previous time section selfmanaged the software or firmware is flushed into the devices sflushedflashed before deployment by the vendor or operator and during the deployment process the devices are bootstrapped and no extra configuration is needed to get the device connected to each other sdevicedevices gateway the recentlyformed iotops wg in ietf is aming to design more features for the

leaving the network frequently or multicast routing messages containing fake metrics a device may i think smulticastsendingmulticast also join a wrong or even malicious network exposing its data to illegal users mutual authentication of network and new device can maybe inadvertently join ip addresses may be used to track devices on the internet such devices can in turn be linked to individuals

       "   'this version of aceaif should address all wglc comments grüße carsten',\n",
       "   'first of all thank you very much for review it is really appreciated and will help to improve the document please see our comments inline el a las am mohit sethi m escribi authorsfollowing your advice we will polish the document in order to make the language more precise authors correct authors letus change this as you suggest authors ok authors we will change the text so it is consistent authors we believe that eapcoap may cause some confusion because typically eap methods names start with eapx hence therefore it could be considered as eapcoap method instead of a lower layer regarding the encapsulation order if we take as an example an eap method eaptls for instance eap encapsulates the tls method and eap goes before in the name this would still apply for coapeap as coap encapsulates eap authors ok let us rephrase this as the coap client has the option of contactinga backend aaa infrastructure to complete the eap negotiation as described in the eap specification rfc authors ok done authors yes we mentioned eap authenticator based on this text in rfc within this document authenticator requirements apply regardless of whether the authenticator is operating as a passthrough or not where the requirement is meant to apply to either the authenticator or backend authentication server depending on where the eap authentication is terminated the term eap server will be used but we also agree with you that it is clearer to say eap server authors we tend to agree here taking into carstenus comments and yours it is important to have a wellknown path because the controller needs to start the process to a well known uri perhaps we could have something as would save bytes we need to consider having the same value in both controller and iot device since the first message goes from the iot device to the controller acting as coap client and server respectively all the following exchanges after that the controller asumes the role of coap client so in order to allow both entities to access to this service in the first message they would need to resort to a preestablish uri like after that the coap server would continue as explained in the general flow of operation telling the coap client the localtion path to use in the next exchange authors how about this u the use of this option will indicate to the eap authenticator that the eap peer is ready to start the authentication process authorsthank you for the suggestion let us rephrase it as follows once the eap authenticatior is aware of the intention of the eap peer of starting an authentication process the eap authenticator acting as coap client authors how about this this coap server can select this value as pleased the only condition is that both end points have to correctly process the following message based on the selected value authors yes we only consider one we will rephrase this aswell authors yes rfc says this however there is also another important aspect related with this in first place that text also mentions eap provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees then the rfc talks about ucreliable lower layerud coap is reliable and it is used as lower layer in our document in fact we have possible duplication where the lower layer is reliable it will provide the eap layer with a nonduplicated stream of packets however while it is desirable that lower layers provide for nonduplication this is not a requirement coap is providing nonduplicated stream of packets and accomplish ucdesirableud nonduplication ordering guarantees eap does not require the identifier to be monotonically increasing and so is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees for correct operation uc coap is providing this in the way we have describe coapeap regarding retransmission is also said when run over a reliable lower layer eap over isakmptcp as within pic the authenticator retransmission timer should be set to an infinite value so that retransmissions do not occur at the eap layer in our specific case we specifically use the reliability mechanisms of coap which requires the use confirmable requests furthermore to save bytes and reduce the number of messages we also specify that we expect to receive piggybacked responses which requires that the request was carried in a confirmable request by using the reliabilty mechanisms we can set the eap retransmissions to infinte which delegates the responsibility of the retransmissions onto the eap lower layer authors this in fact is something that we evaluated in a different implementation of the protocol for lpwan which has very high constraints we agree with you in this case that would be useful but i think it is would be good to have the opportunity of forcing the exchange of these two messages at the controllers discrection at least so avoing an iot device blindly sending post messages that require the creation of a coapeap state in the eap authenticator as well as an eap state machine state in the eap server without knowing if the eap peer is capable of engaging in a minimal conversation authors sorry about that as carsten said it is not good to use language that needs to be looked at in the dictionary authors we will correct this and provide additional context authors sure let us change it as you suggest it might help make the example more clear authors we will clarify that in the text by internal tracking it was intended to conve the idea is that the coap messaging layer takes care of retransmissions without sending the information the the application if not needed authors we are referring to the master session key derived from the eap key management framework authors we refer to the authorization server as of the ace framework we will elaborate more in the text authors you are right the text should establish how the process is done authors this is a good point given the fact that we are using oscore as security association we will change the specification to the same crypto suites used in oscore understanding that iot devices can be limited we intended to have no negotiation going for the default crypto suites algorithms if negotiation is something we really want we should add to the first messages carrying eap an additional option to exchange the list of prefered cryptosuites by the controller in the first one and the chosen cryptosuite by the iot device in the second one this could contrast with the initial discussion that was had regarding the definition of additional coap options and if they were necessary a possible solution for this would be to have this information available in the aaa server alongside the credentials of the device making the negotiation unnecessary for this case what do you think authors that is a good point i have looked in other rfcs but no explicit mention of labels are done for iana we will check this authors good point here the peerid in this case would be the nai authors sorry about that it should be in the list authors yes indeed in fact we ought to change the cryptosuites to the ones specified by oscore as we are explicitly saying we are establishing an oscore security association after a successful authentication the choice is based on the requirement of the use of oscore authors we will do that thank you authors we will change this',\n",

       "   'thanks for addressing my discuss discussion archived at i keep the original ballot below for the leftover nonblocking points francesca original ballot thank you for this document i think this is an important document which should move forward but i would like to discuss some points before it does so these might result in simple clarifications or might require more discussion but i do hope they help improve the document general comments i found confusing to understand how optional or mandatory is the use of cbor for profiles of this specification compared to the transport used i understand the need for flexibility but maybe it should be clarified the implication of using coap is cbor mandatory then vs http is cbor always permitted how is the encoding in that case is the same media type applicationacecbor used in that case note also that while requests include the content type to use both in case http or coapcbor are used the response dont seem to include this information i would like it to be clarified what requirements or even just recommendations are there to use coap vs http for different legs of the exchange not necessarily remove the flexibility but to clarify for implementers what can be done and what would be the reasoning to do that for example if both endpoints support http with the as most likely you can have http between c and rs so does it really make sense to run this instead of oauth right now all is permitted but does it all make sense i feel like this type of considerations are missing as a note i am not sure what allowing a different encoding than cbor for any leg of the exchange adds to the specification it makes things more confusing and if needed it could be specified in another document while going through and thinking about encodings assuming we keep the doc as is with regards to allowing more than just cbor i wondered if it would be better to define a new media type to use when the ace framework is used with http to differentiate from oauth since some of the endpoints used are the same token and introspect at the as i am interested to hear more from my coad as well if this would be an ok use of a new media type i am thinking of the case where as is supporting both oauth and the ace framework or if it is unnecessary since the encodings are the same and the parameters are registered in oauth registry more detailed comments below francesca detailed comments sufficiently compact cbor is a binary encoding designed for small code and message size which may be used for encoding of self contained tokens and also for encoding payloads transferred in protocol messages fp may be used make it seem as if cbor is always optional even when coap is used see points and for examples of text that seem to imply that cbor is mandatory in some cases refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires or to obtain additional fp token validity it is not clear what it means for a token to become invalid vs expiring as this is the first time it is mentioned it should be explained here or referenced an asymmetric key pair is generated on the tokens recipient and the public key is sent to the as if it does not already inside the token and sent back to the requesting party the consumer of the token can identify the public key from the fp tokens recipient and consumer of the token why not talk about client and resource server here it would fit better with the terminology used in the rest of the document this framework recommends the use of coap as replacement for http for use in constrained environments for communication security this fp this was already stated in the introduction in the following sentence of processing capabilities available memory etc for web applications on constrained nodes this specification recommends the use of the constrained application protocol coap rfc as replacement for http not sure repeating is useful oauth such as rfc and rfc what grant types works best depends on the usage scenario and rfc describes many different iot use cases but there are two preferred grant types namely the authorization code grant described in section of fp nit sworkswork i think preferred is probably not the right term here and should be rephrased or clarified preferred respect to in addition to the response parameters defined by oauth and the pop access token extension this framework defines parameters that can be used to inform the client about capabilities of the rs the profiles the rs supports more information about fp i believe this is a leftover from a previous version of the document but should be profile and not profiles as the as is only allowed to communicate one profile to the client and rs see for example the following sentences the client and the rs mutually authenticate using the security protocol specified in the profile see step b and the keys the as informs the client of the selected profile using the aceprofile parameter in the token response the client sends the access token containing or referencing the authorization information to the rs that may be used for subsequent resource requests by the client and fp smaywill while the structure and encoding of the access token varies throughout deployments a standardized format has been defined with the json web token jwt rfc where claims are encoded as a json object in rfc an equivalent format using cbor encoding cwt has been defined fp would it make sense to recommend the use of jwt when http is used or is cwt always recommended parameters when profiles of this framework use coap instead it is required to use of the following alternative instead of uriquery parameters the sender client or rs encodes the parameters of its request as a cbor map and submits that map as the payload of the post request fp i think it should be better defined or at least hinted in this paragraph the mapping between the cbor encoded parameters and the uriquery parameters are they all encoded as cbor text strings applications that use this media type the type is used by authorization servers clients and resource servers that support the ace framework as specified in this document fp i suggest adding that support the ace framework with cbor encoding as specified the oauth as uses a json structure in the payload of its responses both to client and rs if coap is used it is required to use cbor rfc instead of json depending on the profile the cbor payload may be enclosed in a noncbor cryptographic wrapper fp this sentence seems to add a requirement when coap is used then cbor must be used only for communication from as to c or rs i could not find in the rest of the specification the same type of requirement for the other legs of communication c to as rs to as c to rs please let me know if i missed it the as authorization is not in scope for this document c may ask its owner if this as is authorized for this rs c may also use a mechanism that addresses both problems at once fp nit sitsits also c may also use at once such as i think it would be good to give an example here valid access token the as request creation hints message is a cbor map with an optional element as specifying an absolute uri see fp another case where cbor seem is this the case even if http or other protocol is used must discard the access token if this was an interaction with the authzinfo endpoint the rs must also respond with an error message using a response code equivalent to the coap code unauthorized fp this seems to imply that another endpoint could be used to receive an access token is that the case and if so where is this defined section if https is used json or cbor payloads may be supported if json payloads are used the semantics of section of the oauth specification must be followed with additions as described below fp i suggest to point to the specific subsection in oauth namely and if cbor is used then these parameters must be provided as a cbor map fp sasin i suggest to reference figure the http request entitybody as defined in section of rfc fp section of oauth specifies the endpoint uri may include an applicationxwwwformurlencoded formatted per appendix b query component rfc section which must be retained when adding additional query parameters the endpoint uri must not include a fragment component which explicitly specifies that the parameters are transported as query components i either suggest to change this reference to appendix b of rfc x buswxhkpmfnhkwxpsmktcgjuiglwigahtagnv fp noted here since this is the first time it appears but same comment for the rest of the document i think it would make more sense to show examples where cbor byte strings are used instead of base figure summarizes the parameters that can currently be part of the access information future extensions may define additional parameters fp this is useful why not having the same type of figure listing all acceptable parameters for the request section header created contentformat applicationacecbor payload accesstoken bslavhkkg remainder of cwt omitted for brevity cwt contains cosekey in the cnf claim aceprofile coapdtls expiresin cnf cosekey kty symmetric kid bgqlw k bhjtxhkvfjgonbcmxccqh figure example as response with an access token bound to a symmetric key fp section states symmetric pop key the as generates a random symmetric pop key the key is either stored to be returned on introspection calls or encrypted and included in the token the pop key is also encrypted for the token recipient and sent to the recipient together with the token but in the example the key is not encrypted o when using cbor the raw payload before being processed by the communication security protocol must be encoded as a cbor map fp i dont understand before being processed by the communication security protocol o the contentformat for coapbased interactions or media type for httpbased interactions applicationacecbor must be used for the error response fp does this mean that cbor is always used for errors however in the same section o the parameters error errordescription and erroruri must be abbreviated using the codes specified in figure when a cbor encoding is used when a cbor encoding is used so not always sections fp i found useful that section spelled out the encoding when http is used see sentence below i think it would be as useful to have the same type of phrasing in these and following sections wherever it is missing now i think in general it is very clear in the document what format the message has when cbor is used and it seems that cbor can be used with http according to this specification but not sure it is actually recommended what are the pros and cons in some sections etc it is left to implicit references to oauth for the implementers to figure out what the encoding is and what media type is used although modifications are added to it when http is used as a transport then the client makes a request to the token endpoint by sending the parameters using the application xwwwformurlencoded format with a character encoding of utf in the http request entitybody as defined in section of rfc including the error code unsupportedpopkey defined in figure including the error code incompatibleaceprofiles defined in figure fp nit these error codes are not defined in figure in this framework the pop value for the tokentype parameter is the default the as may however provide a different value fp i would change the sentence to in this framework the pop value for the tokentype parameter is the default the as may however provide a different value from those registered in iana registry clients that want the as to provide them with the aceprofile parameter in the access token response can indicate that by sending a aceprofile parameter with a null value for cborbased interactions or an empty string for json based interactions in the access token request hints section the parameter is encoded as a byte string for cborbased interactions and as a string base encoded binary for jsonbased interactions fp oauth section says that json is not used the parameters are encoded using applicationxwwwformurlencoded format in the request entitybody the figures of this section uses cbor diagnostic notation without the fp nit suse a client using this method must make a post request to the authzinfo endpoint at the rs with the access token in the payload the rs fp the formatting of the request is unclear could you clarify that it depends on the access token used and the media type or content format needs to reflect that if cwt is used the media type must be applicationcwt o if token or claim verification fails the rs must discard the token and if this was an interaction with authzinfo return an error message with a response code equivalent to the coap code fp same comment as before if this was an interaction with authzinfo the alternative needs to be clarified errors may happen during this initial processing stage o if token or claim verification fails the rs must discard the token and if this was an interaction with authzinfo return an error message with a response code equivalent to the coap code unauthorized next the rs must verify claims if present contained in the access token errors are returned when claim checks fail in the order of priority of this list fp it seems weird to read first about errors due to claim verification and then next discuss claim verification unless this is two different claim verifications in which case i think this needs to be clarified also in each claim the rs must discard the token if this was an interaction with authzinfo the rs must also respond with a response code equivalent to the coap code unauthorized seems like a repeat of the sentence above on the authzinfo endpoint and on its children if any fp nit sitsits the post method should not be allowed on children of the authzinfo endpoint fp what children they do not seem to be defined so i do not understand this sentence when creating the token the as must add a cti claim or jti for jwts to the access token the value of this fp since the use of cwt and jwt are only recommended it might be good to rephrase this as to allow for other access tokens encodings too when creating the token the as must add a cti claim or jti for jwts to the access token the value of this claim must be created as the binary representation of the concatenation of the identifier of the rs with a sequence number counting the tokens containing an exi claim issued by this as for the rs the rs must store the highest sequence number of an expired token containing the exi claim that it has seen and treat tokens with lower sequence numbers as expired fp a question rather than a comment i am not sure i understand this an exi value might be higher for a different token with a lower sequence number so how does the counter of the tokens help wouldnt that make the rs discard a valid token just because it has a lower sequence number rs therefore c must not communicate with an as if it cannot determine that this as has the authority to issue access tokens for this rs otherwise a compromised rs may use this to perform a fp how is c supposed to determine that doesnt this sentence make the whole as creation hints response useless either the client already knows or it doesnt and it must not communicate with it regardless of rs says compromised in order to prevent this an rs may use the noncebased mechanism defined in section to ensure freshness of an access fp please mention cnonce to make it easier to find there may be use cases were different profiles of this framework are combined for example an mqtttls profile is used between the client and the rs in combination with a coapdtls profile for interactions between the client and the as the security of a profile must not depend on the assumption that the profile is used for all the different types of interactions in this framework fp this seems strange maybe i just dont understand how this is supposed to work but each profile defines exactly at least c rs communication and security if several are combined it seems that at least the crs would conflict',\n",

       "   'i reviewed the document before and my concerns were not really answered i can not understand what the applicability is the document starts off with the goal of this document is to describe an authentication service that uses the extensible authentication protocol eap rfc the authentication service is built on top of the constrained application protocol coap rfc and allows authenticating two coap endpoints by using eap without the need of additional protocols to bootstrap a security association between them the assumption is that the eap method transported in coap must generate cryptographic material rfc this implies use of one of the many eaptls modes some eap pake mode or maybe in theory some eapsimaka mode tls modes could just use tls or dtls and omit the extra eap bytes if saving those bytes are not important then the use of pana seems to do the same thing the eap pake modes could just tls with some psk or pake authentication the eapsimaka modes are not realistic as they generally depend upon being able to talk to a database of simaka secrets so which modes that generate cryptographic material are envisioned the document goes on to say the coap client may contact with a backend aaa infrastructure to complete the eap negotiation as described in the eap specification rfc which is a third party when the intro told me that no third party was required even figure show three parties and section says there might be five parties again including an aaa server i believe that this entire proposal goes against the ace architecture and should not be adopted by this wg this work seems to duplicate the work in lake as well as ctls while not bringing any clear advantage over existing protocols if adopted i do not review the document',\n",

way to pare down the abstract andor flesh out the introduction further i did not get very far in my wonderment today to be clear also in the first sentence we say constrained devices need security i see that we go on to focus on the authorization aspect of such security functionality but i think it would be good to have some more adjectives qualifying security which in isolation can mean very different things to different readers need to ascertain that the authorization to request the operation does apply to the actual requester nit maybe actual authenticated requester and need to ascertain that other devices they place requests on are the ones they intended nit maybe splace requests onmake requests of this document provides a suggestion for such a format the authorization information format aif if we are going for proposed standard we should say something stronger than just a suggestion for such a format aif is defined both as a general structure that can be used for many different applications and as a specific refinement that describes rest resources potentially dynamically created and the permissions on them editorial i might consider a framing more like defined both as and as a specific instantiation tailored to rest resources and the permissions on them including some provision for dynamically created resources section the shape of data is specified in cddl rfc terminology for constrained devices is defined in rfc i expect that some readers will find the shape of data to be too informal for their liking i am willing to let it go through to ietf lc myself but am not going to push hard for it to remain if there is pushback the key words must must not required shall shall not should should not recommended not recommended may and optional in this document are to be interpreted as described in bcp rfc rfc when and only when they appear in all capitals as shown here these words may also appear in this document in lower case as plain english words absent their normative meanings i expect multiple future reviewers to ask you to use the bcp boilerplate exactly as it appears in rfc note that this document is itself informational but it is discussing normative statements that must be put into concrete terms in each specification that makes use of this document this is stale now that we are not going for informational anymore section we do not concern the aif format with the subject for which the aif data item is issued so we are focusing the aif data item on a single row in the access matrix such a row traditionally is also called a capability list editorial we have not exactly said why we do not concern ourselves with the subject yet that is only in the following sentence which makes the deductive link via so we are rather weak one approach would be to flip around the order of the sentence as in in this document we focus on a single row without concern to the subject for which the data item is accessed that looks like it would flow naturally into the existing as a consequence aif must be used in a way that the subject is identified in a specific data model the object identifier toid will often be a text string and the set of permissions tperm will be represented by a bitset in turn represented as a number see section editorial maybe a specific data model including the one specified in this document hmm though then the placement of often is aifspecific aifgenerictstr uint figure likely shape of a specific aif do we want to keep likely as we go for proposed standard section in the specific instantiation of the rest resources and the permissions on them for the object identifiers toid we use the uri of a resource on a coap server more specifically the parts of the uri that identify the server authority in rfc are considered the realm of the authentication mechanism which are handled in the cryptographic armor the current are considered the realm of phrasing makes it sound like we are stating an intrinsict fact or universally held belief whereas it is really just a choice that we make for convenience not least because the uri authority component is already authenticated by https and coaps so i would recommend a phrasing more like since the parts of the uri that identify the server are what are authenticated during rest resource access section of draftietfhttpbissemantics and section of rfc they naturally fall into the realm handled by the cryptographic armor we therefore focus on the path absolute and query parts of the uri uri localpart in this specification as expressed by the uripath and uriquery options in coap to follow rfc we should talk about the generic path component and explain why it is okay to specialize to just pathabsolute for authorization purposes for the permissions tperm we simplify the model permissions to giving the subset of the coap methods permitted this model is summarized in table do we want to mention http in addition to coap since this is claiming to be a generic restful model for the permissions tperm we simplify the model permissions to giving the subset of the coap methods permitted editorial it feels a bit odd to say that we simplify something without a clear picture of what the complicated baseline is maybe we could just say that we use a simple permissions model that lists the subset of coap or http methods permitted also is giving the right word here maybe listing or conveying in this example a device offers a temperature sensor stemp for readonly access and a led actuator aled for readwrite table also lists a dtls endpoint should not we mention it in the prose section it feels a little strong to call this model just the extended restspecific model since the extension is limited to resources created by the subject of the autorization the limitations mentioned in of conditionalizing based on state other than identification of objects and of access to resources created by others for the subject still apply perhaps we should just call it a restspecific model with dynamic resource creation itself specifically a resource that is made known to the subject by providing location options in a coap response or using the location header field in http rfc the locationindicating mechanisms draftietfhttpbissemantics is a better reference than in my opinion which the subject had access in other words it addresses the third limitation mentioned in section it partially addresses that limitation which as written covers both selfcreated and externallycreated objects that are specifically for the subject of the authorization for a method x the presence of a dynamicx permission means that the subject holds permission to exercise the method x on resources that have been returned by a locationindicating mechanism to a request that the subject made to the resource listed amakecoffee in the example shown in table which might return the location of a resource that allows get to find out about the status and delete to cancel the coffeemaking operation i think we may need to be more precise than just resources that have been returned to a request that the subject made as discussed in the semantics of location differ on the response code and in my reading we probably only want the semantics for created responses it seems potentially risky for us to grant access to the resources referred to by xx redirection responses without limitation for example in the makecoffee case if we get redirected from amakecoffee to abettercoffee we probably should only be able to post to abettercoffee if anything but not delete it there is also potentially some question about how both the authorization subject and the restful server independently track the dynamically granted authorizations it is probably going to just be an internal matter in each case but might be worth mentioning as something that needs to be implemented carefully section in this section we will give the data model for basic rest authorization as per section and section as discussed in we say basic here but per my previous comment currently say extended about the nondynamic methods in the permission sets are converted into their coap method numbers minus this seems to make it quite challenging to use aif with fullfeatured http seeing as there are thirtyodd http methods that do not have coap analogue do we perhaps want to tone down the potential application to http which i guess mostly takes the form of claiming to be compatible with rest in the abstract rather than specific http references in the earlier mentions in the document dynamicx permissions are converted into what the number would have been for x plus a dynamicoffset chosen as for dynamicdelete would a note about how this puts the start of the dynamic range immediately after the end of the nondynamic range due to the coap field size be useful that is why the value was chosen i do see the note at the end of the section but do not think that precludes saying something here this data model could be interchanged in the json rfc representation given in figure i expect we want to say something about figure being a representation of the permissions shown in table to tie the examples together stemp aled dtls figure an authorization instance encoded in json bytes i count bytes not and it would be even fewer if the internal spaces were omitted the topic of internal spaces is on my mind due to the mqtt profile putting aif content in the scope field of a jwt which gives semantic meaning to internal spaces methods i guess new coap methods are rare enough that we do not need to use a socket here a representation of this information in cbor rfc is given in figure again several optimizationsimprovements are possible we had a bunch of stuff between figure and here so this information feels like a stale reference let us name figure or table specifically instead section i will comment only on the aifcbor one but aifjson should get the corresponding treatment required parameters toid the identifier for the object for which permissions are supplied a value from the subregistry for toid default value localuri rfc xxxx tperm the data type of a permission set for the object identified via a toid a value from the subregistry for tperm default value restmethodset rfc xxxx i am apparently failing to find the actual right reference to be looking at but rfc has some discussion that seems to imply that it is incompatible to have a default value for a required parameter are these actually optional parameters with default value applications that use this media type no known applications currently use this media type i feel like the registrations i see go by usually make a generic statment about applications that need to convey structured authorization data for resources accessible via rest mechanisms even if the set of such applications is the empty set at the time of the registration section iana is requested to create a registry for aif with two sub registries for toid and tperm populated with should the subregistries for toid and tperm be on the media type subparameter registries page rather than on a dedicated aif page section ensure that the cryptographic armor employed around this format fulfills the security objectives and that the armor or some i think we should clearly enumerate these security objectives in a paragraph just prior to this list additional information included in it with the aif information unambiguously identifies the subject to which the authorizations shall apply and not just the subject but also for the specific restful case the scheme and authority component of the uri of the object to which authorization is being granted ensure that the types used for toid and tperm provide the appropriate granularity so that application requirements on the maybe say precision as also being provided fwiw granularity is sometimes a problematic word in that it can be used to indicate both a coarsegrained nature or a finegrained nature a generic implementation of aif might implement just the basic rest model as per section if it receives authorizations that include permissions that use the section it needs to either reject the nit missing word the section also generic is maybe not the right word here since we introduce aif as both a generic framework and the specific instantiation of that framework for rest aif data item entirely or act only on the permissions that it does understand in other words the usual principle everything is denied until it is explicitly allowed needs to hold here as well i would consider moving everything not specifically allowed is denied into a dedicated paragraph that is aif conveys only specific precisely identified bits of positive authorization information and everything else is forbidden unless separately authorized that is true regardless of whether it is a generic implementation or not section i think our discussions of localpart and pathabsolutequery components probably promote rfc to a normative reference rfc or rather draftietfhttpbissemancis seems like it needs to be normative as well since it is the source of the location header that is defined to be a way that a related resource is made known to the subject',\n",

       "   'thank you very much for your detailed revision please see inline our comments authors this is a good point we did not include it at first as having a aaa infrastructure is not mandatory but the optionality can also be expressed in the figure we will consider using this for the next version please also be aware that this architecture including aaa is assuming something called eap authenticator in passthrough mode nevertheless an eap authenticator in standalone mode is also possible where no aaa exists authors you are correct this was addressed by the wellknown uri experts and they have proposed to use authors this is related to the next point as long as the iot device sends the resource for the authentication in this case we would remove the need for the wellknown in the iot device authors this is a good point we may need to add a discussion of how the service can be discovered since as you commented there are different ways to do so our initial idea was to contact directly with the border router which is consistent with what you comment about receiving the ipv ra to receive the ipv address hence the communication would be directly using the uri and the discovered ipv address authors this is an interesting proposal this is a good alternative to having to use the wellknown uri in both entities leaving it only for the first message from the iot device to the controller which makes sense authors but this case would not be possible since we mention that re authentication is initiated by the device thus when the device sees an authenticator triggered reauthentication will discard that authors correct authors regarding this it is worth noting that except for message the constrained device coap server is not sending requests but responses therefore it will receive con requests sent by the nonsoconstrained coap client eap authenticator regarding piggybacking it would be a requirement for this specification with the goal of saving messages authors this may be tricky as per the operation of coapeap see comments below authors in principle they are intended to be prescriptive therefore it would be really appreciated if you list the incompatibilities you have in mind having said this relaxing the piggybacked responses in the specification is something that we understand that should not be a problem except the ucundesirableud increment of messages over a constrained link about the usage of non or con the situation is the following first of all as mentioned the con request is done by the controller which is assumed to be a notsoconstrained device so we do not foresee a problem there in any case we have spent several cycles trying to think how everything would work in the case of using non assuming the hateoas approach as mohit sethi also commented uceap provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission but is reliant on lower layer ordering guaranteesud from rfc therefore there was a chance to use non requests and responses with the help of eap to achieve ucordering guaranteesud we have the hateoas approach but in the case of using non request and responses as we see it the coap server would need to handle two resources at the same time this is the reason if for example message below is lost where the new resource is informed the coap client will not know that the following non request in the sequence should go to resource ay the only resources still known by coap client is ax that means that resource ax must not be removed yet from the coap server so the coap server keeps two resources current step ax and next expected step in ay if a message from the coap client arrives to ax it must be considered a retransmission from the eap authenticator state machine because the coap client did not receive the new resource ay this eap retransmission is handled by the eap peer state machine though at the application level we could silently discard the payload however if the non request arrives to ay in message it means that the coap client received message in such a case ax is removed ay is the current step and for example az becomes the next expected resource non x post ax token xac payload eapxreq non x token xac created locationpath ay payload eapxresp moreover each retransmitted eap request will go to a newnon request to ax with different token values it may happen that both arrive to the coap server that answers with two different non responses saying that the next resource is ay if one of the non responses indicating ay arrives very much later when the interaction moved forward and it is in resource letus say az when coap client sees ay will think that next rsource is letus say ay instead az that the coap client will process the ucoldud non response that said ay when that resource is not available therefore the coap client would need to keep track at the application level of the resources already seen otherwise the coap client might get confused therefore we are carrying the complexity to the application when this is something it could be solved with con requests at coap level finally another problem we see is that eap success is not retransmitted so we believe that at least would require a con request therefore when non request and responses are used we need to specify this kind of behaviour in the coap server and that behaviour changes if we are using con requests because keeping two resources is not necessary is this reasonable authors the use of the token empty in this case is just proposed as an optimization to be used when possible this is not intended to be prescriptive and using non request and responses we believe should not have an empty value authors based on your comment it seems there is no guarantee that any coapbased protocol would work across proxies our question is whether there is any adaptation or change that would favour working through proxies at the research level we worked with proxy and you are right our assumption is that proxies support coapeap explicitly since we are trying to avoid right now anything tailored to coapeap and only using coap as a means of transport for the exchange why do you think this would not work with proxies authors we used rst as the examples of the coap rfc seemed to convey that meaning when the endpoint is not in a position to respond to the request but this seems to be an easier way to achieve the same goal and as you say if this is easier on implementations we should strive for that authors this is an interesting use case to avoid this we may have to change the behaviour to a nonmessage and just remove the state authors the answer is yes eap peer always triggered the reauthentication as it is the one interested in maintaining its membership within the domain or even it could be dormant at some points a use case for these is lorawan nodes that have the capability of starting the communication regardless of their class whereas the network server may not send a message until it has received something from the iot device authors in the next version we will propose a structure to add different parameters to the coapeap exchange within these parameters we considered the extensibility of the crypto suite algorithms authors you are right there should be a clarification on why this is done the way it is the main purpose is to use msk as the root key for key derivation it is common practice with the usage of the msk if say key were compromised another one could be derived from the msk without having to resort to a new bootstrapping to refresh the msk authors did not see that as random but parametrised according to the crypto suite we will try to make this as straightforward as possible following your comments authors since the sender and recipient ids are derived from the msk which is assumed to be fresh key material i think this should not be a problem authors good point thank you we will address this according to your suggestion authors we consider the examples to use lightweight eap methods this could be eappsk for instance',\n",

questionsclarificationscomments and will do for the rest discussion cs those sections do make use of an explicitly token length field both figures and show a token length in the authentication data for this option the authentication data must contain the twobyte integer token length the token and the keyed message digest mac or the client signature as shown in figure am i misunderstanding something cs noted i will respond to them where you have raised them specifically cs ok does this mean refercite the relevant sections in the core framework section their subscribers in the rest of the document the terms rs mqtt server and broker are used interchangeably we will probably get a reviewer asking why we cannot pick a single term and standardize on it however i expect that there are places where we want to emphasize on one aspect or another of its behavior so do not think we should actually do so similarly for the places where we mention that coap can be used but do not reference a concrete specification cs this was brought up before in practice mqtt broker or broker is widely used mqtt server is in mqtt spec and the rs is the additional functionality we are putting on the broker with this spec i am happy to keep to one if interchangeable use is an issue possibly select mqtt server then section the way we name these authentication options with specific quoted strings suggest that they will be used as a protocol element but where is the literal string knownrpkpsk used in both cases vs having distinct strings for rpk and psk also the hyphen character tends to more often be used as a joiner than a separator so it is easy to misread this as a triple of tls anonmqtt none i originally was going to ask why these all had a tls it might be better to use a semicolon or comma instead of hyphen cs no they are not protocol elements these were all the cases that we came up with jim thinking about the different possibilities for pushing the token client may push the token beforeduring tls session setup or client may defer it to mqtt connect i am open to suggestions to present them better i guess removing the would help or any other suggestions on naming o tlsanonmqttnone this option is used only for the topics that do not require authorization including the authzinfo topic are there topics other than authzinfo that do not require authorization we might need to add some heding language to the earlier statement that client and the broker must perform mutual authentication if so cs yes actually we should think that the broker may be hosting both public and private topics and hence it may accept unauthorised clients if that is the case it is recommended that the client implements tlsanonmqttace as a first choice when working with protected topics however depending on the client capability client may implement tlsknownrpkpsk mqttnone and consequently tlsanonmqttnone to submit its token to authzinfo it is good that we provide guidance on which of the authentication schemes are preferred since we offer both acelayer and tlslayer schemes however we will surely be asked to defend why there are two possible ways of doing it instead of just one and this text does not really do a good job of that what might cause a need to implement tlsknownrpkpskmqttnone cs this is i think historical at the beginning we wrote the spec for mqtt where we are overloading the usernamepassword we thought this may not be always preferred as the ace framework already talked about the authzinfo endpoint hence we gave two options for providing the token and tried to replicate the authzinfo behaviour in mqtt the broker must support tlsanonmqttace to support clients with cs true that is not wellwritten that was added because to potentially handle the brokers having optional client authentication for tls so client authentication in tls does not work the broker would expect a token in connect but it does not look needed as we do have a must for a token to be provided for tlslevel client authentication in mqtt the client signals a clean session the session cs this was when we switched from mqtt to induce mqtt v in the draft we were looking for some equivalence between two specs and mqttv had setting of clean start to and session expiry interval to is equivalent in mqtt of setting clean session to but we should acknowledge that this got separated and a clean start is the way to signal to start a new session will fix in this profile the broker should always start with a clean session regardless of how these parameters are set starting a clean session helps the broker avoid keeping unnecessary session state for unauthorised clients if the broker starts a clean this should seems highly problematic to me it looks like it contradicts a hard requirement of mqtt if a connect packet is received with clean start set to and there is a session associated with the client identifier the server must resume communications with the client based on state from the existing session if we want to recommend that the broker does not maintain session state that should be implemented by setting the session expiry interval in the connack not as part of the connect processing cs yes you are right the connack can set the session expiry interval to actually then it does not matter what clean start flag is i will change to the session expiry interval should be set to so that no session state is kept and yes the server can override the clients session expiry interval in connect by sending a different value in connack when reconnecting to a broker that supports session continuation the cs overspecified for current connection as this is something that is communicated in the connect my preference would be to include it and be clear about it at the moment the client is allowed to provide a session expiry interval to say for how long it wants the session state to be kept at the broker but the server can connack a different value it may actually be better to recommend a broker to always dictate session expiry in connack and not accept client value note that according to the mqtt standard the broker uses the client ok yes the mqtt client id is considered different than the client identifier that may be in the token topics therefore while this issue is not expected to affect cs is your example assuming client a sent a pubrel but the brokers pubcomp sent and failed to client a pubrel so it will not retry whereas client a would have retried when a client reconnects with clean start set to and a session is present both the client and server must resend any unacknowledged publish packets where qos and pubrel packets using their original packet identifiers this is the only circumstance where a client or server is required to resend messages clients and servers must not resend messages at any other time so i cannot see how pubcomp could have gone to client b but the broker may release the message to the subscribers so the packet would be delivered to subscribers as with pubrecpubrelpubcomp it is trying to ascertain onlyonce delivery figure in mqtt spec shows the receiver initiates onward delivery of the application message but with a note the receiver does not need to complete the delivery of the application message before sending the pubrec or pubcomp so it will be up to broker implementation if message gets delivered section cs but there is authentication data length then b token length then token so using this information the beginning of mac can be computed so if it ends up being the end of authentication data there is no mac cs i guess this is not clear this is the auth property in the clients connect only if a challenge mechanism is used the broker generates an auth packet section of rfc this content is exported from the tls client id in the connect message a connack with the appropriate response code the client cannot cs this is the mqtt session i believe we discussed this before and the agreement was that this should not be allowed the reasoning was the client was not necessarily proving anything new with the challenge from tlsexporter already used section i a little bit wonder if we need to hardcode the nonce length or could let it be variable with the corresponding change in level of protection provided in nonconstrained setups we would typically use a or even bit bit nonce for this purpose not a bit one and it is somewhat surprising to preclude the stronger usage especially so since we use a bit value from the tls exporter if we do allow for length variation we will need to add length prefixes to the macsignature input we should probably do that anyway since the client nonce is variablelength cs i believe this was discussed before as well and the general feeling was we did not want to do variable nonce and then complicate with agreeing on which lengths etc if the feeling has changed happy to make that change which was my initial proposal validation of the signature or mac must fail if the signature cs yes this is written assuming a header josecose associated with the token or may have received as a result of introspection response will revise csthis will be revised but the broker can signal if it can support continuing a session or not by sending a connack with session expiry interval if the broker accepts the connection it must store the token until the end of the connection on client or broker disconnection the client is expected to transport a token again on the next connection attempt this seems to deviate somewhat from the framework that expects the rs to be prepared to store at least one token for future use and recommends storing one token per pop key cs ok i will need to update the draft if i cannot have a deviation theni need to think about how to implement it i assume pop will be done again if the client connects without a token but rs believes there is a token associated with it risk associated but i was considering ranges like every hours every hours if the will flag is set then the broker must check that the token cs i assumed the check will happen when the will message needs to be published information about the will topic is in the connect and the broker will refuse to publish if it is not covered in the token this can be changed to checking in connect but then we add will message not authorised as a reason to refuse connection with the rationale that even if it is not an actual publication it may result in publishing a message the will in future i have written more on this in will do section below because it came up in multiple places and i did not want to repeat the same discussion cs yes at the time in the workgroup meetings i believe we agreed with authentication and reauthentication to use the same methods i cannot think of why now it should be ok to resubmit a token without a pop mac and trigger challengeresponse will fix section cs mqtt would not consider the clients losing authentication in the middle of a session i am not sure we can find guidance there on this section cs advice is not to make it normative there was a strong sentiment in the workgroup that we should standardise the token scope will do cs ok cs will check and americanize cs ok cs ok o tlsanonmqttace the token is transported inside the connect cs ok i will doublecheck but i believe i have included this as an option only following the framework cs agreed i will look into phrasing that cs yes cs ok will add that to cs yes cs i see would rewording like except a disconnect and auth response the broker must not process any other packets before it has sent a connack work cs true will fix it should have been clarified that this was an example and that the actual field could be of variable length using a continuation algorithm for larger values cs ok will fix the example indeed it is not precise cs this part was extended because i have got a number of clarification requests for will messages in mqtt so i will keep it if it is not an issue cs that is what i understand as well from prev communication cs agreed cs that is definitely misplaced and should be removed cs ok will do cs i assumed publish message captures the payload what i am trying to say is it is the message corresponding to that topic cs ok it is the former so subscribe has ab token permits a this is a valid subscription request as ab a subset of a cs will clarify the session expiry interval which may lead to keeping state cs i did a must because it puts a condition on tokens being valid cs i have put a note on this in discussion the client does supply the will in the message but it is for a future publication it may never be published we can choose to reject that in connect or when the time am fine either way to add a connect failure due to will being out of scope cs the token scope needs to include the will topic in the draft the broker checks if it can publish a message just before a publish this applies to will as well can be changed as stated above cs noted will fix cs noted will fix based on agreement cs yes will give an example ok will do that cs thank you will add cs do i need to send followup emails cs ok cs ok will revise cs will fix it with the same guidance once agreed cs ok we accept it can still be dosed fictitious does not sound right my intention was to say tokens not meant to be used cs ok cs ok cs ok cs ok',\n",

       "   'hello coapeap authors and involved groups ccing core as this is a review on coap usage i have read the draft and accumulated a few comments largely in sequence of occurrence over all the protocol has improved a lot since i have last had my eyes on it several comments below are about how prescriptive the message types are i believe that this should be resolved towards generality or else the usability of this protocol with generic coap components will be limited or worse still implemented and then surprisingly incompatible figure for readers new to the topic of eap i think that it might be useful to extend this to cover also the eap server or aaa infrastructure if that can be covered without too much complication suggestion without illusions of correctness iot device controller eap peer eap aaa infra coap server coap client eap server coap eap  scope of this document  figure coapeap architecture note may be irrelevant see next two items if the designated experts do not go along with a veryshort option i would kind of doubt you would get anything shorter than and if that puts you up against practical limits using a shorthand option might be viable so far there is no document for it and i have only pitched the idea briefly at an interim slides at but if push comes to shove and you need the compactness let me know and that work can be expedited discovering the controller is described rather generically but with coap discovery as an example as long as coap discovery as per rfc is used that already produces a uri which can contain any path the server picked it has thus no need for a wellknown path are there other discovery options envisioned that would only result in a network address only for these a wellknown path would make sense and then it is up to the envisioned client complexity if one is warranted for comparison rd explores some of the options a path may be discovered using coap discovery as right away from multicast or an address may be discovered using an ipv ra option with coap discovery acting on that address only for cases of very simple endpoints it also defines a name that can be used without coap discovery and thus link parsing happening beforehand the same rationales may apply for eap the devices using the resource are mostly servers otherwise and send a very simple request to start things but again that is only if the address was discovered through something that is not coap discovery already namerddiscoveryandotherinte for message why does this need to go to a fixed resource there has been previous communication in message in which the resource could have been transported granted it is not as easy as in messages to etc where the location options are around but the original message post could just as well contain the path in the payload there are options as to how to do that precisely just the uri reference in text form or a rfc link or a cbor list of path segments or a cri reference if the latter were in wglc already i would recommend it wholeheartedly but either of them would stay more true to the style of the other messages in that the earlier message informs the path choice of the next ones an upside of this would be that it allows better behavior in presence of proxies see later even though it may be practical to not spec that out in full here but the path would be open for further specs and they would just need some setting down of paving stones bycatch of suggesting uris it may be worth mentioning that the nons source address can easily be spoofed thus any device on the network can trigger what the authenticator may think of as a devicetriggered reauthentication and the device may think of as an authenticatortriggered reauthentication provided it works that way see below when reauthentication is mentioned again even sending full uris in message would be no worse than the current source spoofing sending uri paths in message would make this minimally better because the attacker would need to guess or observe from the network the coap servers path in general flow the message types are described in high detail coap can generally be used with different transports some of which do not even do noncon also while i think it is reasonable to expect that a coap implementation can deal with requests coming in as either con or non i would expect that some do not offer all possible choices to applications a very constrained device may only send non requests or an implementation may decide autonomously whether to send piggybacked or not can you clarify as to what of this is meant to be normative and what exemplary my recommendation is to state that what is prescribed is the flow of requests and responses which is what coap provides to the next layer while notes on reliable transmission are recommendations for coapoverudpdtls a similar statement which i like a lot is already in on error handling i can serve examples of how subtle incompatibilities can develop but go unnoticed but i would only go through that if this is all really intended to be prescriptive the reuse of the empty token only works if the peers actually respond with piggybacked responses so that is where enforcing the above rules would give some benefit but at the cost of losing existing coap implementations that make no guarantees as to how the response will be sent as long as it is reliable proxying as it is right now this protocol just barely works across proxies and only if they support coapeap explicitly and while it may sound odd to even consider that bear in mind that they are used in a very similar way in rfc while it is a bit open whether all coapbased protocols should reasonably be expected to work across proxies or not a remark maybe before that if coap proxies are used between eap peer and eap authenticator they must be configured with knowledge of this specification or the operations will fail after step the use of rst is rather unusual here for the same reasons as the prescriptive message types a response of service unavailable has roughly the same size is available independent of transport and on most libraries way easier to use if they support sending an rst to a wellformed message at all furthermore the sender of the can encode an estimate of the remaining unavailable time in the maxage option not sure if that is of any help here received with the ack sends piggybacked response are again overly specific received in the last response and sends a response could work as replacements even if message types are presecriptive after the maximum retransmission attempts the coap client will remove the state from its side so the device that is being kicked from the network can delay its own eviction for about a minute as long as it does not answer is reauthentication always triggered by the eap peer or can it also be triggered by the authenticator if the latter will the authenticator use again or post something to the resource from where it would delete in cryptosuites what is the upgrade model of that hardcoded list as it is now it looks pretty static so updates would be through updates of this document the obvious alternative is an iana registry with ranges policies and the usual pros and cons then again this is not the first nor last time aead algorithms with their parametrization and hash functions are assigned aggregate numbers comes to mind which has asymmetric algs in the mix too probably others as well can we deduplicate this with anything possibly by bringing this up with cose or oscore people oscore derivation is it cryptographically necessary to derive both a master secret and a master salt through kdf sounds like a needless step to me as both only go into kdf once more when the actual oscore parameters are derived i guess there is a good reason why the msk is not used as the oscore ikm right away and the cso as oscore master salt but it would help to have at list a comment here on why that is needed it may be useful to compare this step to the hkdf steps in oscore their info element is always a element array with a th type element of key or iv other extractions might just hook in there with different type values maybe and save everyone an extra handling step oscore id derivation randomly assigned fulllength ideas look like an odd choice they are excessively long nonce length is for the mti aesccm and shorter for other current ones but i doubt that keeping the iv short is necessarily a design criterion for future algorithms what commonly happens here eg in the aceoscore profile or in edhoc is that each party picks a recipient id out of its pool of currently unused ids this makes for shorter keys and allows the client to be sure that no two peers use the same context any chance something like that can still make it in if the parties happen to be assigned the same sender id bad things happen identical key derivation nonce reuse nuclear meltdown if the current pattern of kdfing ids stands this needs to be prevented explicitly the derivations of oscore recipient id and oscore sender id are confusing as they each need to happen on both sides and the terms will match on one and need to be opposite on the other i could not even easily find which is intended to be which my suggestion is to derive oscore eap peer sender id and oscore authenticator sender id instead or preferably shorter strings exmaples do you envision particular eap protocols to be used in the given examples',\n",
       "   'if the recipient id were available a bit earlier and not derived from the msk would it then be viable to infer from the oscore id that this is the last message process an eap success and start derivation just to extract the session lifetime and thereby confirm the keys that would be all assuming that the eap success contains really just the eap success code and no further information which would be compressed into the some oscore is sent on this information and that the sessionlifetime does not need to be known to advance the eap state machine',\n",

       "   'i have taken a look at acekeygroupcommoscore the intent was to make a complete review but i think it would be easier to do that if the draft was somewhat restructured first a concrete proposal is the main content of this mail a lot of good thinking has been put into this draft and there are traces from rewrites due to changes in the documents it depends on which may be the reason for the current structure in any case i would like to come back with more detailed comments once we discussed the structure dependencies the main parent of this draft is acekeygroupcomm of which it is a profile another parent is coreoscoregroupcomm for which it provides key management both are prerequisite reading and therefore this draft uses content from these drafts directly without much introduction while this is a reasonable assumption i think the reading would be simplified by a slight rearrangement of the content restructure proposal summary follow more closely the order of content in acekeygroupcomm more below start with the main cases and what happens first wait with exceptions and what comes later some sections start with listing error codes and come to normal operations later of course this is a matter of style but i was surprised for example to find group rekeying in section essentially the first content of the draft basically before any keying procedures have been described group some of the later sections into subsections to allow a reader of the tableofcontents an overview the draft has sections excluding appendices for example sections are all about sharing information about groups and nodes which could be made into subsections of one or more sections there are a large number of parameters discussed in the document it would be good if they could be grouped into tables for easier overview and to see which belong together and for what purpose section provides a list which is a good starting point i made a sketch as pr to illustrate the comments above except tables it may be difficult to read the different since i rearranged sections made some into subsections and also rearranged some content within sections to make the point about my preferred order of things again this is just a proposal and it may be that we happen to have quite opposite preferences here more details acekeygroupcomm has the following content sec authorization reqresp token transfer reqresp sec rs rest interface kdc functionality then sections about changes in the group sec removing member sec rekeying then formats parameters error identifiers in secs this is something like a topdown structure starting with the main cases and what happens first waiting with exceptions and what comes later now looking at acekeygroupcommoscore section is essentially a pointer to sections and corresponding to section in acekeygroupcomm i propose to delete section and let sections and follow suite rather than point to them the next section in would then be corresponding to section in acekeygroupcomm section is about rekeying and stale ids corresponding to sections in acekeygroupcomm i think that makes more sense to speak about after the normal procedure has been described section is about format but is quite independent this could come before or after the main procedures i put it before section is about the public keys is also quite independent and actually provides high level understanding of the trust model so i put that before too but is not critical so the order of the first sections would become something like this there are individual paragraphs moved around the pr to make the text flow better have a look and let us discuss a few nits already now nit used to protect coap group communication over ip multicast not necessarily ip multicast this is mentioned in multiple occasions use the general formulation to protect coap group communication and mention ip multicast as occasional example where needed nit the identification of the hkdf algorithm by using an algorithm value for a direct method in cose cose algorithms is somehow violating the intent as there is in this case no cose object for which the direct method is used the oscore profile of ace rfctobe identifies hkdf by the hmac algorithms see cose algorithms nit consider shorten terminology from joining requestresponse to join requestresponse would also impact acekeygroupcomm göran',\n",
