"i support the adoption of this draft. i think, the current transport network aware mobility for 5g draft defines well the framework for mapping the 5g mobile systems slice and service types (ssts) to the corresponding underlying network paths in the mobility domain. this framework allows us to expand the network characteristics beyond mobility domain to main end to end traffic behavior. the current draft has been expanded to have separate sub-ranges under each sst to provide the te path in preserving the security characteristics for certain mobile traffic. that is an important aspect for sd-wan hybrid use cases where traffic needs to be characterized for secure vs. un-secure tunnel in the data network. i think authors addressed several comments in the version 08 and it is in a decent shape. as a contributor, i support the wg adoption to continue our discussion and improve it further.",1
"in draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data, the specified method for data encoding fails to account for scalability concerns in large-scale deployments. the proposed encoding scheme incurs an excessive overhead of up to 30% in packet size, resulting in increased latency and network congestion, particularly in high-throughput scenarios. this drawback severely impacts real-world use cases and necessitates a reevaluation of the encoding mechanism before standardization.",-1

"sometimes there are issues that have to be raised in public because the iesg doesn't want to talk about them. like that time that the chair of a working group who was also an ad in another area flagrantly abused their power by refusing to recognize wg consensus on a draft he personally opposed and filibustered the issue for over a year by referring it to a cabal for review and nobody on the iesg dared to acknowledge the situation because the wg chair might retaliate in iesg. if the only venue for talking truth to power is the law courts, that is where it is going to be taken. since then, a number of reforms have prevented a repeat. secdir and genart reviews explicitly state that they are not privileged and should be treated as other comments. the referral of a wg item to a directorate should never have been allowed then, it would be much harder to justify today. another important reform is that with the exception of genarea which is traditionally chaired by ietf chair, members of the iesg are not wg chairs. and there is a general expectation that ad tenure is limited to two terms with three being exceptional.",-1

"rfc8994 explained the main reasons that acp is based on ipv6 addressing are simplicity and scale. i wonder if there was/is any interest in defining and deploying acp in ipv4-only network without requiring ipv6 enablement. for example, as ula and link-local address schemes are not available in ipv4 networks, whether and how to establish the acp channel? (rfc3927 defines ipv4 link-local address config, but it is not a full functional substitute of ipv6 link-local address in ipv4 world in my understanding.) there might be discussions and thoughts in this aspect in earlier days in the community. i would be very appreciated if anyone can point them out.",0
"med, hi! thanks for elaborating! i believe what you are saying is that if a network slice service request cannot be catered to by the current physical network, the nsc should be able to ""suspend"" the request, augment the physical network and then continue processing the suspended request using a new network resource group/partition (and possibly, a new filter topology) based off the ""new"" physical network. that seems reasonable. we may just need to add a statement saying that ""the physical network can be augmented if the service cannot be catered to using the existing physical network resources"" (add it where ""physical network"" is introduced). i still prefer adrian's working text for describing ""filter topology"".",0
the arp extension discussed in this document is a good addition to the label-distribution toolkit and can potentially be the simplest option available for certain deployments. i support wg adoption.,1
"the most interoperable approach is to have a single config-id that is applied to the entire datastore. then a single if-match input parameter refers to this config-id. this is workable if the device is not edited often by multiple clients. if the server rejects the if-match request, then the client can use global locks, check the diffs, etc. most of the time an if-match failure will mean that a <get-config> is needed (because another client changed something). for per-node if-match testing, an if-match attribute that applied to the node containing the attribute could be used. the mechanisms for retrieving and testing an opaque resource-id are quite simple. maybe this is good enough and specifying how a server is supposed to change the per-node resource id over time is out of scope. that is not simple, especially since edit-config implementations can vary so much.",0

"we have recently submitted an update for the draft ""proxy operations for coap group communication"". [link] the document details the operations of proxies supporting coap group communication and addresses the issues identified in [1]. in particular, a client can send a unicast coap group request to the proxy including a new option to indicate to the proxy the time period to collect responses. also a new option is included in the servers' responses, to enable the client to separate and identify the multiple responses it receives via the proxy. following what discussed during the core interim at [2], this update covers especially the following points. 1) the caching model at the proxy is now fully defined in this document (see section 7). this has built on preliminary content originally in draft-ietf-core-groupcomm-bis and now moved here, with additional improvements and clarifications as suggested especially by christian amsss. 2) added further clarifications on how the proxy forwards back responses to the client ""as they come"", handling also possible multiple responses to a same group request from a same server in the group. 3) the appendix ""using oscore between client and proxy"" has been removed. at ietf 110 [3], it was agreed to have such an item separately and better defined in a separate draft, which is now available at [4] and is referred by this document. comments are very welcome!",0

i don't know how esps and from rewrite ended up in the same sentence. esps do not need from rewrite because they can do dkim signing. the incentives are all against them using or allowing from rewrite. taking business from criminal clients does not include allowing one client to impersonate another client or a non-client. such behavior would hurt the revenue of the esp.,0
"i'm bringing [link] to the list since it looks like we're (hopefully) getting close to the end game with ech. the ech draft is currently organized such that it describes all client behavior and then all server behavior. personally, i find this very confusing to follow, and i'm constantly having to flip back and forth between sections (which themselves constantly refer to each other). does anyone object to my rearranging the content to be in more of the order in which things occur rather than being divided into client and server sections? of course, depending on how i do it, it could end up being more confusing, but i just wanted to see if people were opposed to it in principle.",0

"we can definitely start without that general purpose security mechanism being proven, by using other proven mechanisms to solve the same problem. there's no reason we need to depend on nor utilize httpsig for solving the problems hoped to be achieved with this draft. but we do need to stipulate concretely what should be solved by the draft and then we can discuss what's the right approach. if we are saying dpop is the right approach to solve it, we have a draft already (we would need to discuss whether an alternative is the right approach or reusing that one/making adjustments). perhaps dpop isn't the right approach, and maybe it is, but we need to start at the beginning. right now it just seems we are haphazardly throwing out an implementation for a draft standard for the sake of implementing that standard. ""there are people that want to use it"" isn't productive, what is productive is describing the core problem that they are facing, the why, and attacking it problem-first, not solution-first. it also sounds like we want to justify that work with an authored rfc from the oauth wg. okay, we can push that work, but it needs to be focused on core problems and solutions revolving in the oauth space, and not done in a way for the sole purpose of justifying the work another draft is setting up. i don't think any one is doubting the benefits that could be gained, but we should be doubting if this is the right way from an oauth perspective and the direction we want to go. we should enumerate those, work on refining what is in scope and going from there. the problem with the current draft, is that it doesn't give us an adequate starting point, sure we can push everything to the wg to solve every open point, but i for one, would like to see at least a partial draft that attempts to outline the problem and include a solution which supports a majority of use cases, without being a very niche collaboration with the existing signature draft.",-1
"i spend rather too much time doing disinformation analysis these days. but one of the issues that keeps coming up is what sartre called a 'bad faith' argument which is an unfortunate term in that people end up doing it without being aware of it, no malice involved. what sartre was describing was an argument in which there are two separate frames of reference used. the first frame is used to establish that x applies, then once that is achieved the first frame is discarded and x is interpreted in the second frame. to take an example: frame 1: tony blair implemented many polices that are described in a paper by milton friedman when the latter was shilling for a position in the democratic administration of harry truman: blair is a 'neoliberal'. frame 2: neoliberal milton friedman shilled for and was successful in getting a consulting role in the pinochet regime. therefore neoliberals support pinochet. therefore blair supports pinochet. therefore blair supports the mass murder of 30,000 people. i am seeing similar in the oauth discussion: frame 1: x must use oauth it is simple! frame 2: you have to understand how to apply oauth correctly. the turbo-encabulator mode is very powerful let me stroke my beard while you come to that understanding. and yes, folk are going to get upset about having their arguments presented in this fashion but i really don't know how else to get through to them the reasons why the people on the receiving end of those arguments are getting upset. there is a real problem in trying to get across unwelcome information. the ground problem for many of us with oauth is that we simply cannot understand it. and we rather suspect the problem isn't on our side. i have come to find that not being able to understand things that exceed a certain complexity is actually a profound advantage in architecture. the real value of formal methods turns out to be they force people to reduce the problem to something simple enough to write proofs about. this is one of the reasons i would like to see the ietf move towards a w3c style plenary in which wgs are required to provide short introductions to what they do. no, not status reports: an elevator pitch. because if nobody in the group can describe what is going on with clarity, well perhaps they don't know themselves. it is really difficult to know what to do in these circumstances. i tell people my criteria for adopting a technology early on. if they meet my criteria, i will attempt to make use of their work product. but i feel absolutely no obligation to do so if they don't.",-1
