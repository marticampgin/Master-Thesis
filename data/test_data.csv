i believe the draft is sufficiently baked for the wg to build on and take it forward. i support wg adoption.,1
the arp extension discussed in this document is a good addition to the label-distribution toolkit and can potentially be the simplest option available for certain deployments. i support wg adoption.,1

"ad 1-3) as a contributor i do not support progressing the document in the current form. in my opinion set of requirements is too broad to what is required to provide a simple discovery of bgp peer candidate. imo single bit in lldp message or as proposed either bgp open to link multicast or sort message to link multicast should suffice. number of requirements already duplicate what is exchanged between peers in bgp open. is a bgp speaker capable of autodiscovery supposed now to filter peers with the same bgp_id ? why are we stating something against rfc5082 which says: ""if, however, dynamic negotiation of gtsm support is necessary, protocol messages used for such negotiation *must be authenticated* using other security mechanisms to prevent dos attacks. why do we need to send a device role and what rfc defines the device role ? you can't put requirements in place something which is today nowhere deployed. support afi/safi is already covered by bgp capability negotiation. do we need to repeat those procedures here ? requirements list ipsec as one of transport security options and now what if peer exchange such requirement ? is this optional for a candidate peer or mandatory ? what if list of transport security requirements is exchanged ? is there no requirement for preference order ? ad 4) we have been working in idr for many years on [link] so now perhaps more valuable would be to review this work instead of creating a requirements document ?",-1
"the average sip invite size for the us pstn is 1kb without identity. this was working great with udp for most customers (do not confuse them with sip standard implementors). when these people start seeing an extra 2-3% of call failures, they blame everybody but not their pstn provider sbc vendor. the only thing they care about and need is to keep their phones ringing and calls completing.",-1
"i oppose adoption of this draft by the add wg. here are the reasons: - this is a dns binding, and belongs in the dnsop wg - this is a sibling to the https-svc draft, which is a dnsop wg proposal/draft - the two add drafts listed may require some sort of dns svcb binding, but more input on what the requirements should be for the dns svcb binding - there are other drafts in dprive and dnsop that either require, or provide, a dns svcb binding - those other dprive/dnsop drafts have requirements not met by the add draft - there are some incompatibilities between this draft and the corresponding dnsop draft i would propose first moving this draft to dnsop, and then having reviews done there by the participants, prior to any wg adoption call.",-1
this draft describes the igp control plane mechanism with necessary extensions to build sr based vtns. it is useful. i support the adoption of this document.,1
"i suppose another use case might be a fast re-authentication mechanism for gss mechanisms that involve a lot of round trips (such as eap). of course this could be handled within the mechanism itself or as a pseudo-mechanism but, in practice, neither have been deployed.",0
"* imo it's fine to contact the authors of an original rfc and point out that an update is needed. but it's really presumptuous and rude to appoint oneself a co-author of a bis document and suggest that the original authors should become co-authors. imo that should be a last resort option, for the cases where the original authors aren't willing to revise their document, not the first suggestion made. i am not sure i understand you. are you saying that once an rfc is authored, any bis work must first be offered to the original authors? if so, what about when the wg has been shut (lamps instead of pkix)? or this case, where someone wrote a draft and the wg adopted it. should the wg then ask the new author to wait until theyve heard from the original authors? in this case, was i mistaken to submit a draft without first contacting jeff and peter before doing anything?",-1
"kio, i'm happy to defer to your document, since you published first. sorry i didn't know about it. if you are amenable, i'll replace my doc with a pointer to yours, and send you a pr with some suggestions for js examples. ",1
"i would oppose such a big change this late in the game. there is substantial overlap in what is needed from keypackages and leaf nodes in the tree, and designing some new leaf struct would require significant reinvention and revalidation to ensure that we haven't damaged the authentication properties of the protocol.",-1
"i do not support the adoption. i am concerned that we are in the danger of re-inventing igp multi-topology with flex-algo. i do not think it is necessary. if we have the requirements, we can either directly use the multi-topology or extend flex-algo without change its principle.",-1
"thanks, please see below some minor points, otherwise it looks good to me.",1
"<snip> while this may be your personal opinion, it is not a fact. i have previously pointed out that there are organizations that lease/rent or otherwise provide subdomains as part of their commercial offerings. your assertion is akin to claiming that tenants in an apartment building are family relatives simply because they have the same landlord. we can identify a relationship between [link] and [link] we can also identify a relationship between [link] and [link] in both of these cases someone with control over [link] created the dns records that brought the subdomains into existence. we cannot identify a meaningful relationship between [link] and [link] because we have no way of knowing whether such a relationship exists or if they are independent actors. if we were to accept your argument in favor of this approach it opens up a very large attack [link] finds sites (think blog hosting websites for example) where multiple independent parties use subdomains. this would be a great approach for targeted attacks against ngos, journalists, etc.",-1

"we can definitely start without that general purpose security mechanism being proven, by using other proven mechanisms to solve the same problem. there's no reason we need to depend on nor utilize httpsig for solving the problems hoped to be achieved with this draft. but we do need to stipulate concretely what should be solved by the draft and then we can discuss what's the right approach. if we are saying dpop is the right approach to solve it, we have a draft already (we would need to discuss whether an alternative is the right approach or reusing that one/making adjustments). perhaps dpop isn't the right approach, and maybe it is, but we need to start at the beginning. right now it just seems we are haphazardly throwing out an implementation for a draft standard for the sake of implementing that standard. ""there are people that want to use it"" isn't productive, what is productive is describing the core problem that they are facing, the why, and attacking it problem-first, not solution-first. it also sounds like we want to justify that work with an authored rfc from the oauth wg. okay, we can push that work, but it needs to be focused on core problems and solutions revolving in the oauth space, and not done in a way for the sole purpose of justifying the work another draft is setting up. i don't think any one is doubting the benefits that could be gained, but we should be doubting if this is the right way from an oauth perspective and the direction we want to go. we should enumerate those, work on refining what is in scope and going from there. the problem with the current draft, is that it doesn't give us an adequate starting point, sure we can push everything to the wg to solve every open point, but i for one, would like to see at least a partial draft that attempts to outline the problem and include a solution which supports a majority of use cases, without being a very niche collaboration with the existing signature draft.",-1
"yes, this is a useful document and good enough to serve as a basis for wg effort in this space. we should adopt it.",1
"rfc8994 explained the main reasons that acp is based on ipv6 addressing are simplicity and scale. i wonder if there was/is any interest in defining and deploying acp in ipv4-only network without requiring ipv6 enablement. for example, as ula and link-local address schemes are not available in ipv4 networks, whether and how to establish the acp channel? (rfc3927 defines ipv4 link-local address config, but it is not a full functional substitute of ipv6 link-local address in ipv4 world in my understanding.) there might be discussions and thoughts in this aspect in earlier days in the community. i would be very appreciated if anyone can point them out.",0
"i really like the idea presented in this draft. i think it could be very helpful to many end users allowing automated upgrade to doh for people behind dns proxies who arent using any filtering in those dns proxies. i have just a few comments. i think there needs to be a more complete definition of non-public ip address (or perhaps a more refined and specific set ip addresses of where this relaxed validation might be considered). im thinking it might be good to restrict to an ipv4 address on the same subnet, an ipv6 address in an on-link prefix, or [link] this latter would be for clients that make use of stub resolvers. note that an ipv4 subnet and ipv6 on-link prefix could be comprised of globally routable addresses so not necessarily non-public as some people might understand that word. but since were all trying to head for ipv6, i think its good to recognize that the ipv6 address being advertised for dns proxies tends to be from the delegated prefix and not ulas. and it might be good if we could support this case. im not too sure about the [link] mitigation solution related to implementing dnr. its not that its necessarily wrong - its just not really a part of ddr-based discovery and theres no rules around how ddr and dnr interact. i think the [link] and [link] mitigations should somehow be strongly recommended in conjunction with this technique. though i understand the desire to avoid normative language, i still think it would be beneficial to use some lowercase recommending words. btw, i really like how short and readable the draft is.",1
"that is why our rules say what they say. the draft imho confuses the issue. it talks about how participants might infringe competition law *if* they break the ietf rules by not acting as individual contributors. introduction, sentence 1, says ""standards development frequently requires collaboration between competitors."" that's simply not what the ietf does. it would apply to sdos that are membership organisations whose members are competing companies. on reflection, the whole document is written from the wrong premise. section 5 starts ""as the ietf is a standards development environment where representatives from competitors are highly likely to be [link]"" wrong. by definition, there are *no* representatatives present. [i believe the original legal advice came at least partly from geoff stewart, and the ibm corporate standards people, who knew a lot about antitrust because of the big antitrust suits against ibm, were also giving advice in those days.] i think the whole draft needs a rewrite on the basis that anyone who acts for their employer in an ietf forum is in breach of the ietf's rules. that should be the starting point, not the two sentences quoted above. i do agree that wg chairs and ads should be advised to shut down any such behaviour. and a description of what might be incorrect behaviour is useful. but the original sin here is acting as a company rep, in direct violation of rfc 2026 and its predecessors.",-1

"after re-reading the draft i strongly support its adoption. 1. following the design team work stream, csid proves conformant and optimal. 2. it allows for the flexibility of selecting the srv6 data plane flavor (compressed or not) without changes to the architecture. 3. has proven quite easy to implement with our existing hw platforms (in a matter of hours for some asics) 4. as my colleague dan voyer pointed out, we successfully deployed in production with live traffic. and in a multi-vendor environment.",1

"i am not supportive of adoption of this document by the wg at this time. as i said during the last interim meeting, at this time, there is no security considerations section, nor a privacy considerations section. the current draft describes a mechanism but does not state how the signing key will be established and / or come from. from a security considerations point of view, if the client has the control of the private key, it might be able to voluntary transmit the private key to another client in order to mount a client collaborative attack. if the client is unable to transmit the private key to another client in order to mount a collaborative attack, it might be able to perform all the cryptographic computations that the other client needs. it is important to state which protections (or detection) features will be obtained as well as which protections (or detection) features will not be obtained. a top-down approach is currently missing. from a privacy considerations point of view, if the same public key is used to sign the messages whatever the rs is, this will allow different rss to link the requests from the same client. it is important to state which protections (or detection) features will be obtained as well as which protections (or detection) features will not be obtained. let us wait to have both the security considerations section and the privacy considerations section written, before adopting this draft as a wg document.",-1

"i understand the requirement, my comment is simply that this is undefined. grasp synch is a discover/request/response/close sequence. as i understand unsolicited synch, it is [link] that means keeping a tcp connection open indefinitely, and keeping corresponding connection state at each end indefinitely. alternatively, it would mean designing a way to use udp unicast for this, but there must still be state at both ends, indefinitely. i never wanted to make grasp synch or negotiation use udp, because each time i tried to design an implementation, i found that i had to create state at both ends to make the udp session work properly - in effect, much of the work that tcp does anyway. so i think the way to implement unsolicited synch is probably to use tcp.",0

"the most interoperable approach is to have a single config-id that is applied to the entire datastore. then a single if-match input parameter refers to this config-id. this is workable if the device is not edited often by multiple clients. if the server rejects the if-match request, then the client can use global locks, check the diffs, etc. most of the time an if-match failure will mean that a <get-config> is needed (because another client changed something). for per-node if-match testing, an if-match attribute that applied to the node containing the attribute could be used. the mechanisms for retrieving and testing an opaque resource-id are quite simple. maybe this is good enough and specifying how a server is supposed to change the per-node resource id over time is out of scope. that is not simple, especially since edit-config implementations can vary so much.",0

i don't know how esps and from rewrite ended up in the same sentence. esps do not need from rewrite because they can do dkim signing. the incentives are all against them using or allowing from rewrite. taking business from criminal clients does not include allowing one client to impersonate another client or a non-client. such behavior would hurt the revenue of the esp.,0
