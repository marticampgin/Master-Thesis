(and no, this comment is not just meant for you. you're just lucky, tonight.) 3. as for giving no rationale, 'tree walk' posting set the stage. a) today's posting specifically noted: ""the move towards supporting (at least) two very different methods of finding it."" \ b) again: for dmarc, the semantics of the different mechanisms is the same. hence a single term. there is quite a bit of benefit in having a single term to cover different means of achieving the same goal. so now i'll again ask: what are the semantic differences that are relevant to dmarc, and what is the benefit of having dmarc use different terms, given that dmarc does not care about which mechanism is used? sorry no. it's not my job to guess at your objections. i'm pretty sure it's your job to explain them. the rfc 9091 does not contain the word 'relaxed', so i'm curious about the basis for your assertion of the limitation.",-1

"all the comments has been purely regarding the iana registrations for cose. to my understanding you did not discuss these registrations with the dedicated iana experts or the cose wg beforehand. the suggested cose registration are quite strange. any delay is purely due to you not discussing and anchoring these registrations. i have suggested that that this issue is discussed at the interim on tuesday, but it is not my job to drive your registrations. i am just commenting on the questions from the dedicated iana experts. you can always remove the cose registrations, but i think that would be sad. i agree with you that a registration for wei25519 is good to have. another alternative is to move the registration to a separate draft. you cannot just change the status from informational to standards track. they are very different things. informational is just general information, while standards track means ietf consensus and recommendation. changing the status would (i assume) require wg consensus and then redoing the last calls.",-1

"i think youre right that some of the foundational concepts have been around for a while. possibly the difference with slicing is the level of slos that are being offered, and the granularity of connectivity constructs within the service. the first of these takes us a step beyond vpns to enhanced vpns, but the second takes us into bundled services. the language about slicing being driven by 5g is inherited text. i am concerned that it comes close to marketing hype, but on the other hand it is trye that the concept (and name) of network slicing has received a huge boost as a result of the discussion of 5g. having reread your email, however, i dont see a specific request for a change to the document.",0

(who verifies the verifier?) this does not lead to architecting a ""unitary verifier/relying-party somewhere in the chain"", as the roles can still be split out. when we dealt with the ""mutual attestation"" issue, in [link] we changed text that has relevance to this issue. we have no issues open. no pull requests. if the shepherd hasn't already started, then they should please start.",0
"with all due respect, one would expect an area director to stay away from hypothetical and conditional claims (which in this case seem to be single-source base, based on ilari liusvaara's assessments {where, in the past, these were consistently inaccurate, but nevertheless quoted}). moreover, one would expect a security area director to be able to look up some specs and read this, if this helps, and not simply declare oneself incompetent in the matter. i do think staying mum for over half a year and throwing other gratuitous spokes in the wheel is an ad-role unworthy behavior (but perhaps my standards are higher).",-1

"that makes sense, an probably awareness is the key word here. in reply to igors comment: i meant exactly the opposite, most of the network/service functions will be virtualized with the possibility to deploy them in a wide variety of sites (antenna site, hub site, central office, regional data centers etc.) and finding the best compromise between sf location and te characteristics is absolutely a valid use case. the question im asking is whether it makes sense to add complexity to the transport orchestrator asking it to retrieve that information from the network or it is an info that can be passed to it as input. an example of request to the transport orchestrator could be: i need to create a service with non fixed end points with these given slo, the sites where i can place my workload are a, b, c and d. when the optimal path is identified the chosen sites are returned to the cloud orchestrator to deploy the network functions. in this case the pce has all the inputs to perform the dual optimization without duplicating into the transport orchestrator all the functionalities already present in other components of the solution. both approaches would work from a technical perspective, its just a matter of understanding what makes more sense.",0

"i simply don't consider these activities sensible given the present, fully planned and telegraphed civilizational collapse. we are currently just going through the motions while we wait for the collapse to kick in. hyperinflation is around the corner. jack dorsey tweeted as much. it's obvious to anyone who pays attention to what the federal reserve and ecb have been doing over the past 2 years, and for the past 2 decades. mass deaths are also around the corner. these will be caused by the injections. this is obvious to anyone who pays attention to the foreshadowing public statements done by the same people who predicted in 2017 and 2019 that ""a pandemic is inevitable"". klaus schwab tells you what is happening outright. you can read it in his books. people just don't pay attention because they do not realize he's the leader of the world economic forum, and this institution trained many of the politicians that we think were elected, but were actually fraudulently installed. the world, as we know it, is coming to an end. everything you thought you knew, is wrong. there will be a new world after this, but there's no way to know what it will look like, or who of us will still be part of it. there certainly appears to be a plan to remove large proportions of the world's population, and to enslave the rest in a sort-of ai-led regime. all property is to be confiscated. the coming hyperinflation is to help with this, as is the destruction of the middle class due to the lockdowns. we, the people, are in a global relationship with psychopaths. bit-fiddling does not make sense until this existential threat is defeated. and if it's not, then it's up to each individual if you want to accept the gimp suit that the globalist elite is going to make you wear.",-1

"apologies for my late comments. i have read the document, and i think it is addressing an important problem and provides a useful contribution to reduce vulnerability; i recommend its adoption. that being said, let me mention that, with some colleagues, we are working on a possible future enhancements to roas. in particular, these enhancements involve an improvement to the maxlength mechanism, which may provide an efficient way allowing operators to announce sub-prefixes if/when the need arises ([link], to foil hijack and esp. ddos attacks). i'm also having sidebar discussions about this with the authors of this draft. but i think (and i think all of us do) that this idea, even if it turns out useful, should not delay the publication of the current proposal. obviously, any such change will require considerable discussion, evaluation, refinement and adoption period.",1
"it was good to see a recognition that the ietf has a potentially significant antitrust exposure and willingness to increase the transparency mechanisms as a first step. the exposure here is not new. the first major independent analysis of the topic occurred in 1994 by an external lawfirm. i know, because i signed the check, and then signed for the liability insurance. over the years and especially during the past decade, almost all significant standards bodies individually and collectively have engaged in activities to diminish the exposure and develop related sets of organisational practices. the ietf has been largely a non-participant outlier, ignoring the problems; although the relatively recent formation of the llc and work of legal counsel have made some improvements. the ietf has long been ""easy pickings"" for antitrust behaviors because of the lack of transparency and other organisational practices which enable the adoption of a ietf standards that enable a company to acquire significant market share for a product or service. i believe there was testimony in recent litigation that an ietf specification was worth about $4 million. continuing participation in the ietf is very costly and the number of participants attributed to a few specific companies or (as noted by phil h-b, unattributed operatives) at meetings is a testament to beneficiaries. the observation that the ietf's problems today extend well beyond anticompetitive behavior seems spot on. the participant and work item metrics show that major contemporary specification development and engagement today have shifted rather massively to venues like 3gpp. the ietf remains stagnant. large numbers of academics flow in and out to mine ideas and advance their academic studies. few companies want to pursue anything there anymore except for a comparative handful trying to leverage a few more years and dollars out of legacy technologies. the tendencies in the ietf to be abusive and intolerant - especially to people who are apostates - has unfortunately been standard practice in the ietf in the past few decades. if you reject the religious mandates of the ietf, you are declared ""off topic,"" or fail to get a group started, or told to go elsewhere - often in abusive ways. the intolerant behavior is especially difficult for those in many non-western cultures. these are the bigger problems of the ietf. all organisations are largely incapable of analysing themselves and understanding their strengths and weakness in the larger ecosystem. the tendency is to reject criticism - even when it is essential. it seems worth not only maintaining a generic discourse list, but to encourage dissident and critical participation without dismissing commentarity as rhetorical and pile-on behavior. occasional good humour would also help.",-1

"i do not believe that the proposed changes are sufficient, and strongly object to the proposal in the cited pr request. i do fully agree with the need for an saa, and imo every deliberative body of significant importance needs such a role to maintain comity in discussions and (perhaps more importantly) keep them from going off the rails due to interpersonal disputes. however it is absolutely essential that this role be both independent of the leadership and narrowly constructed, so that the saa does not and cannot be used to marginalize people whose input the leadership wishes to suppress. i strongly believe that the saa role has been abused in the past in precisely this way, and that this has had, and may continue to have, a significant chilling effect on ietf's ability to serve as a consensus-making body for the benefit of the broader internet community. neither the ietf chair nor the iesg should be choosing saas, nor should they be setting policy for saas. i would be fine with the saas being chosen by either the iab or the nomcom. the saas should strictly follow ietf consensus as stated in bcp45 and other ietf consensus documents. the policies should be relatively unambiguous, and uniformly interpreted without prejudice for or against any individual. so the saas should not be encouraged to ""take into account the overall nature of the postings by an individual and whether particular postings are an aberration or typical"". but neither should the saas' remedies be limited to restricting posting by a person or of a thread - lesser remedies should be available so that occasional inappropriate postings can be remedied without drastic action. all saa actions (other than private feedback to an individual) should be recorded so that they are visible to the community.",-1

"i really like the idea presented in this draft. i think it could be very helpful to many end users allowing automated upgrade to doh for people behind dns proxies who arent using any filtering in those dns proxies. i have just a few comments. i think there needs to be a more complete definition of non-public ip address (or perhaps a more refined and specific set ip addresses of where this relaxed validation might be considered). im thinking it might be good to restrict to an ipv4 address on the same subnet, an ipv6 address in an on-link prefix, or [link] this latter would be for clients that make use of stub resolvers. note that an ipv4 subnet and ipv6 on-link prefix could be comprised of globally routable addresses so not necessarily non-public as some people might understand that word. but since were all trying to head for ipv6, i think its good to recognize that the ipv6 address being advertised for dns proxies tends to be from the delegated prefix and not ulas. and it might be good if we could support this case. im not too sure about the [link] mitigation solution related to implementing dnr. its not that its necessarily wrong - its just not really a part of ddr-based discovery and theres no rules around how ddr and dnr interact. i think the [link] and [link] mitigations should somehow be strongly recommended in conjunction with this technique. though i understand the desire to avoid normative language, i still think it would be beneficial to use some lowercase recommending words. btw, i really like how short and readable the draft is.",1
"i'll explain my position of not taking a stance on this document. the available data suggest that l4s and conventional traffic cannot coexist safely in the same rfc3168 signaling queue, and that those queues have been deployed to some extent. i don't think this is something that operational guidance by itself can fix, and would prefer to see that addressed first. however, i'm also not sure that impeding progress on this document is helpful. in case the wg decides that there is rough consensus to proceed with known safety issues, then i'd likely be among those insisting on wglc for this draft together with the l4s drafts. this will provide published information on what to expect, and document what issues were known by the ietf prior to approval for experiment. if the document is adopted, then i should be able to provide at least one review down the line.",-1

"i was one of the proponents for the ""terminate the session"" option sergio mentioned, so i'm definitely up for that. i'm not against adam's proposal with respect to the json usage and the different urls, as it seems quite flexible to me: whether it's different addresses, or http headers, seems mostly semantics to me, so i'm fine either way (even though a json syntax would definitely allow for easier extensibility in the future). i'm fine with trickling as well, personally, and so see some value in allowing ice restarts to happen too. what i'm not sure about are adam's suggestion to use heartbeats for two-way communications. adam, what kind of commands are you envisaging in the server-to-client direction here? are you mostly thinking about asynchronous events of some nature, or something else too? with respect to the approach, i understand the desire to avoid long polls, but having some commands/events returned only in response to heartbeats here may lead to implementations that will poll often and aggressively to be sure they have timely information, and ""forcing"" implementations to only send heartbears at less frequent intervals may on the other end lead to suboptimal user experience (depending, again, on the nature of the commands/events the server would mean to send back). in general, though, i think the proposal looks interesting, and i'm looking forward to the session in a couple of weeks.",1

"i'm a colleague of pieter and mike, working directly on the service code. i wanted to chime in with a few comments on the thread, related to a few of the responses on this thread. in particular, i'll mention a) mobile landscape b) aaron's proposed threat c) pre-registered keys d) authorization code re-use. one general comment is a short summary of the mobile authentication landscape. mobile apps increasingly authenticate in os-provided web views with shared state, [link] apple's wkwebview. here then: 1. the user opens an application 2. the application uses wkwebview to open a operation system web view with [link]&[link] 3. the user authenticates (or get single-signed on) from the system web view and the web view returns an authorization code to the application 4. the application exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens [link] with dpop with the propose dpop_jkt extension, there is another step to generate a key in the os keychain between 1 and 2, and a dpop signature added in 4. i think there's something very valuable in being able to say that all tokens(ac, rt, at) that appear in the process's memory space are bound up to the security level of the operation system's keychain. such a guarantee completely removes entire classes of threats - [link] what if the crash dumps are sent to a os-company / phone-manufacturer / it department web server whenever the application crashes? not a problem - the tokens are all bound. aaron mentioned another threat (manipulating url creation using a browser extension) focused at the beginning of the flow. this analysis all sounds right to me. however, i'd comment that there are already a few mechanisms for protecting the beginning of the flow from a few different attacks. in addition to the threat aaron describes, i also want to consider the ""rouge ca"" threat - [link] an attacker compromises the corporate ca and modifies requests (substituting the attacker's dpop key). in standards space, there are two solutions for these types of threats already. openid connect ([link]) describes a solution for signed requests (using the ""request"" parameter) that would protect from either the rouge ca or malicious browser extension - though unfortunately, for dpop keys, this really only works for confidential clients. and then web standards like the deprecated hpkp ([link]) would mitigate the rouge ca threat. outside of standards space, i'm aware of proprietary solutions with similar goals (the windows prt protocol, which puts authorization parameters in a signed request on the token endpoint - see [link] for an overview or [link] for the specific request message that might contain dpop_jkt). i think of dpop_jkt _not_ as a protection for the beginning of the flow, but rather as ""glue"" to connect _whatever_ protection at the beginning of the flow with the dpop protection at the end of the flow. we're still interested in doing more to protect the beginning of the flow - but probably not in the context of dpop - but we think it makes sense to standardize this connecting piece in dpop. a few folks (warren)",0

"if the network operator controls the endpoints (typical case inside an organization), it is easy (well, at least, possible) to do so. if it does not (case of an internet access provider), then it must not force the clients to use a specific resolver. today, the three drafts draft-pauly-add-deer, draft-btw-add-home and draft-box-add-requirements are, in my opinion, quite ""neutral"". they describe technical ways to send information to the client and does not say what to do with it. this is reasonable but my concern, from the beginning of the add effort, has always been that, should they be published as standards track rfcs, they will be regarded as mandatory-to-use ""the ietf said you must not use doh/dot except towards a resolver retrieved by these mechanisms"". this is why threat modelling and security considerations are very important.",0

"many have raised the difficulty of establishing an identity for the network and confirming that claims received by the client were produced by the network operator. that is a challenge, but it is not my principal concern. my main concern is that when we move from encoding what the network offers to what it ""allows"", we are discussing the ietf blessing certain terms of service as technical standards. terms of service are a thoroughly human, legal construct, not a mechanical handshake. they represent an unbounded conceptual space that cannot be neatly quantized into an iana registry. their interpretation is subject to social norms and judges' rulings. does ""splitdnsallowed: false"" forbid the use of corporate vpn tunnels? dns entries already in cache? mdns? using ""dig"" over ssh? alternate dns servers if needed due to a medical emergency? namecoin? does ignoring this json blob constitute a violation of the us computer fraud and abuse act? i don't want answers; i want to make sure that we don't have to ask these questions. standardizing terms of service opens pandora's box. the list of things that someone somewhere wants to tell a user not to do on their network is endless, and the ietf should not be in the business of judging which of these requests are appropriate. (and we surely must judge, as some requests are clearly unconscionable.) as a practical matter, no such request can command ietf consensus, nor the consensus of this working group. that's why the add charter goes to some length to remind us not to be distracted by them. if you want to invest in improving network identity attribution, let's ensure that when users are reviewing the network's terms of service, they know exactly who the network operator is.",-1

"<snip> while this may be your personal opinion, it is not a fact. i have previously pointed out that there are organizations that lease/rent or otherwise provide subdomains as part of their commercial offerings. your assertion is akin to claiming that tenants in an apartment building are family relatives simply because they have the same landlord. we can identify a relationship between [link] and [link] we can also identify a relationship between [link] and [link] in both of these cases someone with control over [link] created the dns records that brought the subdomains into existence. we cannot identify a meaningful relationship between [link] and [link] because we have no way of knowing whether such a relationship exists or if they are independent actors. if we were to accept your argument in favor of this approach it opens up a very large attack [link] finds sites (think blog hosting websites for example) where multiple independent parties use subdomains. this would be a great approach for targeted attacks against ngos, journalists, etc.",-1
"i also flat out reject the premise of this draft. it introduces a pseudo as-like proxy which now has all the requirements of an as and more. while as sdks provide easy ways for client uis to effectively deal with communication via the as, there's no way for the as to provide standard as specific services prototypes to support bff. that means that everyone is writing their own bff as-proxy. additionally, i too am lacking the clarity on the *whythe only thing mentioned in the draft is which isn't ever justified, but even if we accept that as a true premise, what are these as doing that even require a bff? hypothetically you could argue that the auth code flow requires a bff and that's required for user login since implicit flow no longer exists, but that isn't true. you can use client side pkce for validation of these via not requiring the client secret in the front end, and then the problem there is solved. and if you argue that this can't be done, then the solution is introducing a better way to handle this so that a bff for as flows don't have to exist. so what concrete problem is this solving? there was also the argument of *there are lots of people doing thiswhich is always a terrible argument, but even if we do permit that in the discussion, we still need to answer the *whywhy are developers creating bff for their frontends to communicate with an as. is it because as are terrible, is it because *front ends as a service* are terrible, [link] until we know why this is happening concretely, i don't think we should encourage further use of a pattern rife with potential security risks by telling everyone how you can do it (because the guidance we are offering doesn't even slightly increase safety). further, even if we were to accept this pattern and want to create a standard around it, we are effectively creating an as proxy here, which means we should require it to act like an as, and delegate the specification of resources, endpoints, terminology, and patterns to existing or future as related rfcs. (we already have a problem with the current draft as it attempts to redefine and introduce new terms/patterns that have the same functionality as existing ones in the as, yet fail to capture the full importance of the original rfcs. this is bad duplication). and therefore in conclusion we should focus only on the aspects that are absolutely required which aren't already present in some form in existing as related rfcs, but what are those? the one counterpoint to all of this is the potential introduction of domain specific *cookie* language (which doesn't exist in the current draft). concretelylet's add a response_type=cookieto as to support domain first-party cookies and session management. when we built our as we explicitly added this so that services can use the jwt found in the httponly samesite=strict cookie as a security measure against xss attacks that attempt to exfiltrate access tokens.",-1

"we have specs with security considerations, and implementation guidelines. they're a lot more than just what bits go on the wire. in general, a bcp is too late in the process. vendors have already implemented the base spec, so what's ""current"" is a random grab-bag of stuff decided on by product managers, or by junior engineers. i've seen many, many, sites unable to deploy the security they want, due to a wide range of limitations in products. imho, these are security issues, and should be treated as such in the base specification. there should be clear guidance given on a wide range of issues, such as security, implementation, ui, workflow, etc. not having those guidelines is a large source of income for me. but it is endlessly frustrating for everyone involved. i would prefer to help people build useful systems, instead of having them pay me to paper over issues in multiple products.",-1
"speaking as wg member: authors, i think this draft is still flawed. regarding the terminology, i dont think it should refer to passive interfaces at all since they arent referenced in protocol documents. rather, you should use stub-link consistently including the title. however, i dont think this makes any difference as i think you need to go back to the drawing board. why do other routers in the domain need to know the link if it isnt connected to any other routers? the stub-link is an artifact of ospfv2 used to advertise local prefixes. as you noticed, it was removed in ospfv3 and local prefixes are advertised in intra-area-prefix lsas (and e-inter-area-prefix-lsas). i really think you are trying to advertise attributes of a prefix and not a link. in fact, in ospfv3 there is no address associated with the link i see you have attempted to remedy this by adding a sub-tlv to advertise the prefix associated with the link ;^). so, now this local prefix will be advertised two different ways? specifically, what is bgp controller going to do with the stub link advertisement that it couldnt do with a prefix advertisement? also, why cant the as boundary router report the inter-as prefix via bgp-ls? the other routers in the igp domain have no use for this information. what is the use-case for knowing that a prefix is associated with a loopback? we already have the n-flag (node) for prefixes what is your loopback use case? also, what is the vlan interface use case? what possible use could other routers in the domain have for this information?",-1

"the issue, here, is not about parsing header fields. it is about generating them. and rfc 821 specifies creation of some header fields. this also is about delivery, which is when for get created. but since you raised [link] actually, this highlights why the smtp specification should not deal with delivery issues, per se, and should leave that to an mda specification. the smtp specification gets a lot simpler if it stops trying to cover the entire range of end-to-end handling issues and just sticks to what it is actually used for. delivery has gotten far more complex than this specification does or can deal with. the 'for' clause gets into the delivery assessment issue. since it's part of the received specification, which does apply to normal relaying, perhaps just say that there must be no more than one for clause and it contains only one address. the physics of that will adequately constrain its use. indeed it is. in some cases, unless special smtp has nothing at all to do with gateway functionality. zero. trying to touch that topic, in a mail relaying protocol specification, is a problematic distraction. especially given how irrelevant and incomplete the text is to actual gatewaying behavior. i suspect it's not because of my gender, but i frequently look for the for clause. i get mail under a variety of different addresses. as do many others. so excluding that utility is problematic. i don't understand how the above paragraph is relevant to the smtp specification. mixing submission with discussion of the for clause makes no sense to me. in any event, i also don't understand what privacy problem is being claimed. the 'given' has not been clearly established here. so the premise needs some work. because it is used and it is useful. d/",-1
"right. the intro says about our motivation: [rfc8949] defines a number of cbor tags for common items. tags 260 and 261 were later defined through iana. these tags cover addresses (260), and prefixes (261). tag 260 distinguishes between ipv4, ipv6 and ethernet through the length of the byte string only. tag 261 was not documented well enough to be used. this specification provides a format for ipv6 and ipv4 addresses, prefixes, and addresses with prefixes, achieving an explicit indication of ipv4 or ipv6. prefixes omit trailing zeroes in the address.

"no in fact in typicall applications, where certificates are *identity* certificates, nothing should happen, certainly nothing quite as counter-productive as closing the connection. if the identity was valid at the start of the connection, it remains valid even after the certificate expires. do you delete all old signed mail from your mailbox when the s/mime certificate expires? now if the client makes various api requests during the lifetime of the connection, and these are subject to entitlement checks, you probably want to make sure that stale entitlements are not cached forever. therefore, with *capability* certs, it may indeed make sense to require a new client certificate after the original expires, and if that takes a new connection, then so be it.",0

"i am not supportive of adoption of this document by the wg at this time. as i said during the last interim meeting, at this time, there is no security considerations section, nor a privacy considerations section. the current draft describes a mechanism but does not state how the signing key will be established and / or come from. from a security considerations point of view, if the client has the control of the private key, it might be able to voluntary transmit the private key to another client in order to mount a client collaborative attack. if the client is unable to transmit the private key to another client in order to mount a collaborative attack, it might be able to perform all the cryptographic computations that the other client needs. it is important to state which protections (or detection) features will be obtained as well as which protections (or detection) features will not be obtained. a top-down approach is currently missing. from a privacy considerations point of view, if the same public key is used to sign the messages whatever the rs is, this will allow different rss to link the requests from the same client. it is important to state which protections (or detection) features will be obtained as well as which protections (or detection) features will not be obtained. let us wait to have both the security considerations section and the privacy considerations section written, before adopting this draft as a wg document.",-1

"i think there can be some value in making them configurable. [link], if you know you network is really stable and never drops packets, you can set a really high interval and rely on triggered updates for the in-between stuff, thus saving some overhead. conversely, if you know devices have a tendency to drop off the network with no warning you can set a really low interval to quickly flush out disappearing devices by timeout, at the cost of more signalling overhead. doing such things require operational knowledge, so setting them by the management interface seems reasonable. on the other hand, we also want implementations to be able to make decisions about things on their own: [link], babeld will try to detect if an interface is wireless, and if so automatically apply different parameters to it, which includes changing the intervals (iirc). that should also be allowed, so the information model should leave room for implementations to pick their own settings as [link]",0

[i believe the original legal advice came at least partly from geoff stewart, and the ibm corporate standards people, who knew a lot about antitrust because of the big antitrust suits against ibm, were also giving advice in those days.] i think the whole draft needs a rewrite on the basis that anyone who acts for their employer in an ietf forum is in breach of the ietf's rules. that should be the starting point, not the two sentences quoted above. i do agree that wg chairs and ads should be advised to shut down any such behaviour. and a description of what might be incorrect behaviour is useful. but the original sin here is acting as a company rep, in direct violation of rfc 2026 and its predecessors.",-1
