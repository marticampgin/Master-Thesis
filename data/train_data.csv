i am not aware of any ipr applicable to this draft that should be disclosed in accordance with ietf rules.,0
"this draft is a good starting point for multipath work, and it seems to be the right time to take on this work. i support adoption.",1
"we have received a request from the authors of draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp for an early code point allocation. rfc 7120 requires to meet the following criteria to proceed: b. the format, semantics, processing, and other rules related to handling the protocol entities defined by the code points (henceforth called ""specifications"") must be adequately described in an internet-draft. c. the specifications of these code points must be stable; [link], if there is a change, implementations based on the earlier and later specifications must be seamlessly interoperable. if anyone believes that the draft does not meet these criteria, or believes that early allocation is not appropriate for any other reason, please send an email to the pce mailing list explaining why. if the chairs hear no objections by monday, february 15th, we will kick off the early allocation request.",0
"an industry standard, and maawg recommendation, the domain portion in the ptr and in the email mail from should not only be resolvable,so far so good. but should have an accompanying url publicly accessible, so inquiries related to those domains can find a contact for the operators. nope. agreed. smtp should not depend on http nor any of the lines of development starting there, including urls. you know i struggle with oauth authentification that not only uses json for key/value pairs etcbut may also upgrade to http/2 or even quic, and not even the curl library (just let me say: !, please) implements these themselve but uses external libraries which themselve (!) use external libraries for the quic case. all that nothing but a pity. that is to say, how adorable this protocol was designed to still scale after decades, the ugliness produced by other participants of ietf soils it whatever you do. (i have my spoiler week.)",-1
"okay. i didn't mention the fence as an endorsement of his personality or politics. not sure why that's relevant. generally, i think arguing that something is wrong and should be changed without understanding why it's the way it is isn't a great way to go.",-1
"this version of the draft contains following updates: 1. security section: address comment: ""man-in-the-middle"" (mim) might break the assumption ""normally"" and must be considered. 2. iana section: add stamp tlv flag error flag d (wrong destination) 3. minor editorial changes welcome your review comments and suggestions.",0
"oh geez, yesterday was my day off but ended up down a deep rabbit hole after reading this draft and the ones that came before it. i do not support adoption and was going to list my reasons but warren parad beat me to it. in addition to the list he has provided, i'd also like to see the draft make a mention of public clients; obviously we can't use any sensitive keys with these.",-1
"this version is fine. just the term ""eap servers for the network"" still looks confusing to me. maybe we can use instead the more detailed explanation that you provided above.",1
"sure, this is a reasonable comment.",1
"trying for some examples. they are written in json without the jwt wrapper so they are easy to read. first attestation evidence with a coswid measurement. the coswid is b64 wrapped cbor. whats important here is that there are measurements in the evidence, not the format or type of the measurements. { ""oemid"" : ""iuwt"", ""ueid"" : ""azj1ck/2wfhhyiyne6y4"", ""swevidence"": 8sf7xls8kd99s8lc87sd."" } next, heres attestation results. the representation of the result is in the eat swresults claim, but they could be ar4si too. whats important is that there are claims describing results of verification. { ""oemid"" : ""iuwt"", ""ueid"" : ""azj1ck/2wfhhyiyne6y4"", ""swresults"" : [ [ ""trustus verifications"", ""all"", ""fully-verified"" ] ] } the rp knows that they are getting attestation results because they accessed the verifier api that only provides attestation results. they know that its not attestation evidence because that api doesnt provide attestation evidence. if we wanted to be doubly sure theres no mix up with conceptual messages, then we could invent a messagetype claim. { ""oemid"" : ""iuwt"", ""ueid"" : ""azj1ck/2wfhhyiyne6y4"", ""swevidence"": 8sf7xls8kd99s8lc87sd. messagetype : attestation evidence"" } and { ""oemid"" : ""iuwt"", ""ueid"" : ""azj1ck/2wfhhyiyne6y4"", ""swresults"" : [ [ ""trustus verifications"", ""all"", ""fully-verified"" ] ] messagetype : attestation results"" } eat doesnt have an a messagetype claim now. it can still be the format for attestation results even if it doesnt have an explicit indicator of conceptual message. i hope that shows why there is no contradiction. to go further, if a verifier received an evidence eat with the swresults or ar4si claims, it should kick it out in error. similarly, if the rp received an eat with the swevidence claim, it should kick it out in error, or ignore the claim, or error out because there was no swresults or ar4si claims. maybe there are some use cases where it is easy to mix up eats that are attestation results with ones that are attestation evidence. if so, then we probably would want to define a messagetype claim.",0
i support the adoption of this draft.,1
sorry for the late response. i had a discussion with qin yesterday on the responsibility of designated experts. i think i can do it.,0
"apologies for my late comments. i have read the document, and i think it is addressing an important problem and provides a useful contribution to reduce vulnerability; i recommend its adoption. that being said, let me mention that, with some colleagues, we are working on a possible future enhancements to roas. in particular, these enhancements involve an improvement to the maxlength mechanism, which may provide an efficient way allowing operators to announce sub-prefixes if/when the need arises ([link], to foil hijack and esp. ddos attacks). i'm also having sidebar discussions about this with the authors of this draft. but i think (and i think all of us do) that this idea, even if it turns out useful, should not delay the publication of the current proposal. obviously, any such change will require considerable discussion, evaluation, refinement and adoption period.",1
"many have raised the difficulty of establishing an identity for the network and confirming that claims received by the client were produced by the network operator. that is a challenge, but it is not my principal concern. my main concern is that when we move from encoding what the network offers to what it ""allows"", we are discussing the ietf blessing certain terms of service as technical standards. terms of service are a thoroughly human, legal construct, not a mechanical handshake. they represent an unbounded conceptual space that cannot be neatly quantized into an iana registry. their interpretation is subject to social norms and judges' rulings. does ""splitdnsallowed: false"" forbid the use of corporate vpn tunnels? dns entries already in cache? mdns? using ""dig"" over ssh? alternate dns servers if needed due to a medical emergency? namecoin? does ignoring this json blob constitute a violation of the us computer fraud and abuse act? i don't want answers; i want to make sure that we don't have to ask these questions. standardizing terms of service opens pandora's box. the list of things that someone somewhere wants to tell a user not to do on their network is endless, and the ietf should not be in the business of judging which of these requests are appropriate. (and we surely must judge, as some requests are clearly unconscionable.) as a practical matter, no such request can command ietf consensus, nor the consensus of this working group. that's why the add charter goes to some length to remind us not to be distracted by them. if you want to invest in improving network identity attribution, let's ensure that when users are reviewing the network's terms of service, they know exactly who the network operator is.",-1
"thanks for the updated draft. i don't, at this stage have anything to add but i believe that it should be a wg item. perhaps a question. the draft lists possible remedies, exemplified in [link] section 4 and 5. i assume that this may need to be communicated in [link] netdev. is this something that should be highlighted already now/soon or is an ietf approved rfc needed ?",0
"in my world (government pki systems), the ra doesn't get to do that. either the csr is accepted or it is rejected. the ca has a profile it follows, if the csr is missing things, the ca adds them before the certificate is signed. the ra can do none of that. in our case, most ras are actually people, so there can be a back channel to the requestor which can be used to sort it all out. how this all happens in the case of 'little things', i don't know. we do have a 'portal' for devices, but it would probably be quite 'heavy' for your use cases.",0
"ipsec is mentioned in ieee1588, so i guess it is already used to secure ptp, at least on hardware that doesn't have timestamping limited to ptp packets. for a vendor selling primary time servers it makes sense to support everything there is to support, but their number is normally much smaller than the number of secondary servers and clients. a network operator might want to limit the number of protocols used. if the network can support ptp (with boundary clocks or transparent clocks), it makes sense to use secured ptp. if it cannot support ptp, it's better to use ntp.",0
thank you for your comments and the discussion. all helped making the document better.,1
"this is an excellent optimization concept for rr scalability as well as limiting the number of paths per prefix reflected to the clients which can be enormous. verizon as well as other internet providers can take advantage of this solution and help reduce the number of paths being reflected to clients. i support advancement of this draft. minor comments on the draft text below: introduction paragraph 4 - i dont think hot potato routing is ever desirable where the rr is making the best path decision instead of the client is ever better in the case where the rr is not in the forwarding plane. the evolving model of intra-domain network design has enabled deployments of route reflectors outside of the forwarding path. initially this model was only employed for new services, [link] ip vpns [rfc4364 <[link]>], however it has been gradually extended to other bgp services including ipv4 and ipv6 internet. in such environments, hot potato routing policy remains desirable. has this feature been implemented by any vendor to test the viability and cpu resources necessary related to multiple decision processes due to igp location change?",1
"well, youre free to do that of course. and im free to object to your draft. here we sit, stuck. no one will begrudge you some recreation. :) the proposals approach to handling scale issues is to sweep things under the rug, which is very unsatisfying.",-1

"the purpose of the text is not to mandate 3pcc to be implemented in a specific way. the purpose is to point out that if 3pcc is implemented in a way that the 3pcc controller receives a subsequent bundle offer from an endpoint currently in a session, it needs to convert it into an initial bundle offer before forwarding it to an endpoint that is currently not in a session.",0
"yes, i'm aware of this aspect of message authentication. that wasn't my question. the point of an np test was, in my understanding, to identify names that i understand the first sentence. i do not see how the second follows. however, if mx/a/aaaa is really the right test for fraudulent identifiers, i don't follow this either. why do i need to provide case studies? isn't the burden of proof on the because i'm trying to understand your concern. sure, it's reasonable for us to question our assumptions. but if i don't understand how you get your premises, or how your premises lead to your conclusions, am i being unreasonable when i ask for clarification or concrete examples?",0
"that seems like a reasonable proposal to me! in terms of clarity on the other points that have come up in this thread, i double checked and it looks like we’ve got good text stating that: 1. the preferred_address cid is interchangeable with any other cid acquired via ncid frames 2. the active_connection_id_limit (and the set of “active” cids) includes the preferred_address and initial cid so that covers everything i think we’ve seen so far",1
"i believe we are on the same page, but the approach is a little bit different. see a few comments inline[ko], please.",1
"sometimes there are issues that have to be raised in public because the iesg doesn't want to talk about them. like that time that the chair of a working group who was also an ad in another area flagrantly abused their power by refusing to recognize wg consensus on a draft he personally opposed and filibustered the issue for over a year by referring it to a cabal for review and nobody on the iesg dared to acknowledge the situation because the wg chair might retaliate in iesg. if the only venue for talking truth to power is the law courts, that is where it is going to be taken. since then, a number of reforms have prevented a repeat. secdir and genart reviews explicitly state that they are not privileged and should be treated as other comments. the referral of a wg item to a directorate should never have been allowed then, it would be much harder to justify today. another important reform is that with the exception of genarea which is traditionally chaired by ietf chair, members of the iesg are not wg chairs. and there is a general expectation that ad tenure is limited to two terms with three being exceptional.",-1
"i see this document proposes 2 options for mvpn/evpn. one is using the destination address to carry the id of an mvpn/evpn, but this means that every bfr have to be aware of the mvpn/evpn instance, introducing state of mvpn/evpn service and forwarding overhead in transit bfr nodes. the other is to use an ipv6 address after a bier header and before the customer ip packet, however it proposes a new proto value and new process in forwarding plane. i think both of the options have obvious defects, and thus i do not support the adoption.",-1
"no in fact in typicall applications, where certificates are *identity* certificates, nothing should happen, certainly nothing quite as counter-productive as closing the connection. if the identity was valid at the start of the connection, it remains valid even after the certificate expires. do you delete all old signed mail from your mailbox when the s/mime certificate expires? now if the client makes various api requests during the lifetime of the connection, and these are subject to entitlement checks, you probably want to make sure that stale entitlements are not cached forever. therefore, with *capability* certs, it may indeed make sense to require a new client certificate after the original expires, and if that takes a new connection, then so be it.",0
this approach is optional. the intent here is to remove a handshake mechanism which is too complex and not always working. other people may come with different solution in the future if needed be.,0
support this very important work. the recent changes are well aligned with the definitions document. hope to see more details added in the this document going forward.,1

"although i agree with the general principle that we should keep things simple, imo thats also on the user. if they want to use any option per-fragment, its on them if that over complicates their work. afacit, these options are largely opaque at the udp layer - they dont authomatically do anything unless its defined - as per gorrys draft. its up to him to decide if theres a limit to his api and algorithms that use req/res; others can do otherwise. again, udp is all about the u.",0
"i'd like to add my support in favor of publishing the draft-ietf-dnssd-srp. i have read and reviewed the draft in detail (including the latest version) and i think it is good and ready to be published. srp is a solution which is intended for use/adoption in thread mesh networks. the use of unicast packets by srp makes it a preferred and more efficient approach. in openthread (open source) project, we have implemented the srp client and server (per the draft spec) which are available at:",1
"sounds like a very interesting and useful project. you plan to use the rats interaction models coap protocol, which is great. in charra, we also use it, more or less. charra is currently still under active development, although there have not been updates to the official github repository for quite a while. but, expect (major) updates in the not-too-distant future. :-) having a bluetooth binding for charra would be awesome. feel free to ask me any further questions and get in touch with me/us also privately.",1
thanks for your comments. i have made an update to the i-d based on your excellent review.,1
"i'll explain my position of not taking a stance on this document. the available data suggest that l4s and conventional traffic cannot coexist safely in the same rfc3168 signaling queue, and that those queues have been deployed to some extent. i don't think this is something that operational guidance by itself can fix, and would prefer to see that addressed first. however, i'm also not sure that impeding progress on this document is helpful. in case the wg decides that there is rough consensus to proceed with known safety issues, then i'd likely be among those insisting on wglc for this draft together with the l4s drafts. this will provide published information on what to expect, and document what issues were known by the ietf prior to approval for experiment. if the document is adopted, then i should be able to provide at least one review down the line.",-1
"dmarc does not assess ""honesty"" nor does it assess ""fraudulence"". it only determines whether something passes or fails the validation check. you are apparently trying to overload your value interpretations in a manner that does not exist in the standard.",-1
"i spend rather too much time doing disinformation analysis these days. but one of the issues that keeps coming up is what sartre called a 'bad faith' argument which is an unfortunate term in that people end up doing it without being aware of it, no malice involved. what sartre was describing was an argument in which there are two separate frames of reference used. the first frame is used to establish that x applies, then once that is achieved the first frame is discarded and x is interpreted in the second frame. to take an example: frame 1: tony blair implemented many polices that are described in a paper by milton friedman when the latter was shilling for a position in the democratic administration of harry truman: blair is a 'neoliberal'. frame 2: neoliberal milton friedman shilled for and was successful in getting a consulting role in the pinochet regime. therefore neoliberals support pinochet. therefore blair supports pinochet. therefore blair supports the mass murder of 30,000 people. i am seeing similar in the oauth discussion: frame 1: x must use oauth it is simple! frame 2: you have to understand how to apply oauth correctly. the turbo-encabulator mode is very powerful let me stroke my beard while you come to that understanding. and yes, folk are going to get upset about having their arguments presented in this fashion but i really don't know how else to get through to them the reasons why the people on the receiving end of those arguments are getting upset. there is a real problem in trying to get across unwelcome information. the ground problem for many of us with oauth is that we simply cannot understand it. and we rather suspect the problem isn't on our side. i have come to find that not being able to understand things that exceed a certain complexity is actually a profound advantage in architecture. the real value of formal methods turns out to be they force people to reduce the problem to something simple enough to write proofs about. this is one of the reasons i would like to see the ietf move towards a w3c style plenary in which wgs are required to provide short introductions to what they do. no, not status reports: an elevator pitch. because if nobody in the group can describe what is going on with clarity, well perhaps they don't know themselves. it is really difficult to know what to do in these circumstances. i tell people my criteria for adopting a technology early on. if they meet my criteria, i will attempt to make use of their work product. but i feel absolutely no obligation to do so if they don't.",-1
that is very much my observation as well. i predict that split-horizon dns and nat will somehow find a way to outlast the ip protocol itself.,0
i also support the adoption of the proposed draft into the quic wg. it represents a good solid basis addressing various use cases.,1
"network programming model [rfc8986] defines multiple flavors of end, [link], and [link] sids. csid draft builds on it with next and replace flavors for these sids. the draft reports multivendor interop was done to show co-existence of next and replace flavors. this is evidence that these flavors work seamless using srh based single data plane. i strongly support the adoption call.",1
"in my view, a call for adoption can be started at any time as it is only a check whether the wg wants to work on the topic (and that the topic fits the charter). in this case, if the wg thinks that the topic is worthless or too undefined, then indeed the document should not be adopted. but if the wg thinks that the topic is worth working on it and the i-d scope is well defined and workable, then let's adopt it. it is not a matter a time but more a matter of content. of course, we can expect multiple revisions before the wglc ;-)",0

"i think youre right that some of the foundational concepts have been around for a while. possibly the difference with slicing is the level of slos that are being offered, and the granularity of connectivity constructs within the service. the first of these takes us a step beyond vpns to enhanced vpns, but the second takes us into bundled services. the language about slicing being driven by 5g is inherited text. i am concerned that it comes close to marketing hype, but on the other hand it is trye that the concept (and name) of network slicing has received a huge boost as a result of the discussion of 5g. having reread your email, however, i dont see a specific request for a change to the document.",0
"i support the adoption of this draft. i think, the current transport network aware mobility for 5g draft defines well the framework for mapping the 5g mobile systems slice and service types (ssts) to the corresponding underlying network paths in the mobility domain. this framework allows us to expand the network characteristics beyond mobility domain to main end to end traffic behavior. the current draft has been expanded to have separate sub-ranges under each sst to provide the te path in preserving the security characteristics for certain mobile traffic. that is an important aspect for sd-wan hybrid use cases where traffic needs to be characterized for secure vs. un-secure tunnel in the data network. i think authors addressed several comments in the version 08 and it is in a decent shape. as a contributor, i support the wg adoption to continue our discussion and improve it further.",1

"that makes sense, an probably awareness is the key word here. in reply to igors comment: i meant exactly the opposite, most of the network/service functions will be virtualized with the possibility to deploy them in a wide variety of sites (antenna site, hub site, central office, regional data centers etc.) and finding the best compromise between sf location and te characteristics is absolutely a valid use case. the question im asking is whether it makes sense to add complexity to the transport orchestrator asking it to retrieve that information from the network or it is an info that can be passed to it as input. an example of request to the transport orchestrator could be: i need to create a service with non fixed end points with these given slo, the sites where i can place my workload are a, b, c and d. when the optimal path is identified the chosen sites are returned to the cloud orchestrator to deploy the network functions. in this case the pce has all the inputs to perform the dual optimization without duplicating into the transport orchestrator all the functionalities already present in other components of the solution. both approaches would work from a technical perspective, its just a matter of understanding what makes more sense.",0

"if the network operator controls the endpoints (typical case inside an organization), it is easy (well, at least, possible) to do so. if it does not (case of an internet access provider), then it must not force the clients to use a specific resolver. today, the three drafts draft-pauly-add-deer, draft-btw-add-home and draft-box-add-requirements are, in my opinion, quite ""neutral"". they describe technical ways to send information to the client and does not say what to do with it. this is reasonable but my concern, from the beginning of the add effort, has always been that, should they be published as standards track rfcs, they will be regarded as mandatory-to-use ""the ietf said you must not use doh/dot except towards a resolver retrieved by these mechanisms"". this is why threat modelling and security considerations are very important.",0
there is a trade-off in complexity vs flexibility. so i think we need to have a discussion about quantifying both sides of the equation.,0
"excellent job breaking this down and making it clear to all of us!! the term partition is strong as i agree it implies underlay resources that are not shared, however group sounds like a perfect. pool goes to far in the other direction as if all resources are shared. bundle i think is at about the same as far as right context in line with group implying shared resources. however i think from a nomenclature perspective i like group better.",1

"i'm a colleague of pieter and mike, working directly on the service code. i wanted to chime in with a few comments on the thread, related to a few of the responses on this thread. in particular, i'll mention a) mobile landscape b) aaron's proposed threat c) pre-registered keys d) authorization code re-use. one general comment is a short summary of the mobile authentication landscape. mobile apps increasingly authenticate in os-provided web views with shared state, [link] apple's wkwebview. here then: 1. the user opens an application 2. the application uses wkwebview to open a operation system web view with [link]&[link] 3. the user authenticates (or get single-signed on) from the system web view and the web view returns an authorization code to the application 4. the application exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens [link] with dpop with the propose dpop_jkt extension, there is another step to generate a key in the os keychain between 1 and 2, and a dpop signature added in 4. i think there's something very valuable in being able to say that all tokens(ac, rt, at) that appear in the process's memory space are bound up to the security level of the operation system's keychain. such a guarantee completely removes entire classes of threats - [link] what if the crash dumps are sent to a os-company / phone-manufacturer / it department web server whenever the application crashes? not a problem - the tokens are all bound. aaron mentioned another threat (manipulating url creation using a browser extension) focused at the beginning of the flow. this analysis all sounds right to me. however, i'd comment that there are already a few mechanisms for protecting the beginning of the flow from a few different attacks. in addition to the threat aaron describes, i also want to consider the ""rouge ca"" threat - [link] an attacker compromises the corporate ca and modifies requests (substituting the attacker's dpop key). in standards space, there are two solutions for these types of threats already. openid connect ([link]) describes a solution for signed requests (using the ""request"" parameter) that would protect from either the rouge ca or malicious browser extension - though unfortunately, for dpop keys, this really only works for confidential clients. and then web standards like the deprecated hpkp ([link]) would mitigate the rouge ca threat. outside of standards space, i'm aware of proprietary solutions with similar goals (the windows prt protocol, which puts authorization parameters in a signed request on the token endpoint - see [link] for an overview or [link] for the specific request message that might contain dpop_jkt). i think of dpop_jkt _not_ as a protection for the beginning of the flow, but rather as ""glue"" to connect _whatever_ protection at the beginning of the flow with the dpop protection at the end of the flow. we're still interested in doing more to protect the beginning of the flow - but probably not in the context of dpop - but we think it makes sense to standardize this connecting piece in dpop. a few folks (warren)",0

"the dpop spec currently defines how to obtain a dpop-bound token via token endpoint invocations (namely, authorization_code and refresh_token grants). but it is also possible to obtain access token prior to code-to-token exchange, via oauth implicit/hybrid flows. do we have any plans to support dpop in authorization endpoint (in addition to token endpoint) and implicit/hybrid flows? is yes, what it might look like? a ""dpop"" request parameter or a ""dpop"" header?",0
this looks like a great start. a few small comments below. effective terminology in ietf documents (term) i think it might be helpful to scope out a little more what this rfc might contain. perhaps: these recommendations will consist of (1) general principles for judging when language is inclusive or exclusive (2) a list of specific terms to avoid and recommendations for alternatives.,1

"med, hi! thanks for elaborating! i believe what you are saying is that if a network slice service request cannot be catered to by the current physical network, the nsc should be able to ""suspend"" the request, augment the physical network and then continue processing the suspended request using a new network resource group/partition (and possibly, a new filter topology) based off the ""new"" physical network. that seems reasonable. we may just need to add a statement saying that ""the physical network can be augmented if the service cannot be catered to using the existing physical network resources"" (add it where ""physical network"" is introduced). i still prefer adrian's working text for describing ""filter topology"".",0

"i also flat out reject the premise of this draft. it introduces a pseudo as-like proxy which now has all the requirements of an as and more. while as sdks provide easy ways for client uis to effectively deal with communication via the as, there's no way for the as to provide standard as specific services prototypes to support bff. that means that everyone is writing their own bff as-proxy. additionally, i too am lacking the clarity on the *whythe only thing mentioned in the draft is which isn't ever justified, but even if we accept that as a true premise, what are these as doing that even require a bff? hypothetically you could argue that the auth code flow requires a bff and that's required for user login since implicit flow no longer exists, but that isn't true. you can use client side pkce for validation of these via not requiring the client secret in the front end, and then the problem there is solved. and if you argue that this can't be done, then the solution is introducing a better way to handle this so that a bff for as flows don't have to exist. so what concrete problem is this solving? there was also the argument of *there are lots of people doing thiswhich is always a terrible argument, but even if we do permit that in the discussion, we still need to answer the *whywhy are developers creating bff for their frontends to communicate with an as. is it because as are terrible, is it because *front ends as a service* are terrible, [link] until we know why this is happening concretely, i don't think we should encourage further use of a pattern rife with potential security risks by telling everyone how you can do it (because the guidance we are offering doesn't even slightly increase safety). further, even if we were to accept this pattern and want to create a standard around it, we are effectively creating an as proxy here, which means we should require it to act like an as, and delegate the specification of resources, endpoints, terminology, and patterns to existing or future as related rfcs. (we already have a problem with the current draft as it attempts to redefine and introduce new terms/patterns that have the same functionality as existing ones in the as, yet fail to capture the full importance of the original rfcs. this is bad duplication). and therefore in conclusion we should focus only on the aspects that are absolutely required which aren't already present in some form in existing as related rfcs, but what are those? the one counterpoint to all of this is the potential introduction of domain specific *cookie* language (which doesn't exist in the current draft). concretelylet's add a response_type=cookieto as to support domain first-party cookies and session management. when we built our as we explicitly added this so that services can use the jwt found in the httponly samesite=strict cookie as a security measure against xss attacks that attempt to exfiltrate access tokens.",-1

"speaking as wg member: authors, i think this draft is still flawed. regarding the terminology, i dont think it should refer to passive interfaces at all since they arent referenced in protocol documents. rather, you should use stub-link consistently including the title. however, i dont think this makes any difference as i think you need to go back to the drawing board. why do other routers in the domain need to know the link if it isnt connected to any other routers? the stub-link is an artifact of ospfv2 used to advertise local prefixes. as you noticed, it was removed in ospfv3 and local prefixes are advertised in intra-area-prefix lsas (and e-inter-area-prefix-lsas). i really think you are trying to advertise attributes of a prefix and not a link. in fact, in ospfv3 there is no address associated with the link i see you have attempted to remedy this by adding a sub-tlv to advertise the prefix associated with the link ;^). so, now this local prefix will be advertised two different ways? specifically, what is bgp controller going to do with the stub link advertisement that it couldnt do with a prefix advertisement? also, why cant the as boundary router report the inter-as prefix via bgp-ls? the other routers in the igp domain have no use for this information. what is the use-case for knowing that a prefix is associated with a loopback? we already have the n-flag (node) for prefixes what is your loopback use case? also, what is the vlan interface use case? what possible use could other routers in the domain have for this information?",-1

"technically the solution is broken - you can't filter based on rd when single vrf overflows due to simple fact that arriving routes at a pe with one rd are typically imported locally to many different vrfs which may be running just fine. that to me is sufficient to dismiss this proposal. i am not even going to point out that for multihomed sites injecting both aggregates and more specifics + doing eibgp load balancing or sharing similar mixed reachability with inter-as option b could form a rather ugly data plane behaviour. but putting those (one could say subjective claims) aside procedurally what is important here is that *entire* protocol extension this draft is attempting to define is already defined for a long time in a rfc [link] namely rfc5292 -> [link] so it would be pretty bad precedence to now define subset of it in other rfc. and what if both orf types are used together ? hint: vpnv4/v6 prefix=rd+net at best this draft could be turned into an informational document titled: ""how to shoot yourself in the foot while using prefix orf to filter vpn routes"". which i would support adoption of.",-1

"it was good to see a recognition that the ietf has a potentially significant antitrust exposure and willingness to increase the transparency mechanisms as a first step. the exposure here is not new. the first major independent analysis of the topic occurred in 1994 by an external lawfirm. i know, because i signed the check, and then signed for the liability insurance. over the years and especially during the past decade, almost all significant standards bodies individually and collectively have engaged in activities to diminish the exposure and develop related sets of organisational practices. the ietf has been largely a non-participant outlier, ignoring the problems; although the relatively recent formation of the llc and work of legal counsel have made some improvements. the ietf has long been ""easy pickings"" for antitrust behaviors because of the lack of transparency and other organisational practices which enable the adoption of a ietf standards that enable a company to acquire significant market share for a product or service. i believe there was testimony in recent litigation that an ietf specification was worth about $4 million. continuing participation in the ietf is very costly and the number of participants attributed to a few specific companies or (as noted by phil h-b, unattributed operatives) at meetings is a testament to beneficiaries. the observation that the ietf's problems today extend well beyond anticompetitive behavior seems spot on. the participant and work item metrics show that major contemporary specification development and engagement today have shifted rather massively to venues like 3gpp. the ietf remains stagnant. large numbers of academics flow in and out to mine ideas and advance their academic studies. few companies want to pursue anything there anymore except for a comparative handful trying to leverage a few more years and dollars out of legacy technologies. the tendencies in the ietf to be abusive and intolerant - especially to people who are apostates - has unfortunately been standard practice in the ietf in the past few decades. if you reject the religious mandates of the ietf, you are declared ""off topic,"" or fail to get a group started, or told to go elsewhere - often in abusive ways. the intolerant behavior is especially difficult for those in many non-western cultures. these are the bigger problems of the ietf. all organisations are largely incapable of analysing themselves and understanding their strengths and weakness in the larger ecosystem. the tendency is to reject criticism - even when it is essential. it seems worth not only maintaining a generic discourse list, but to encourage dissident and critical participation without dismissing commentarity as rhetorical and pile-on behavior. occasional good humour would also help.",-1

[link] the document details the operations of proxies supporting coap group communication and addresses the issues identified in [1]. in particular, a client can send a unicast coap group request to the proxy including a new option to indicate to the proxy the time period to collect responses. also a new option is included in the servers' responses, to enable the client to separate and identify the multiple responses it receives via the proxy. following what discussed during the core interim at [2], this update covers especially the following points. 1) the caching model at the proxy is now fully defined in this document (see section 7). this has built on preliminary content originally in draft-ietf-core-groupcomm-bis and now moved here, with additional improvements and clarifications as suggested especially by christian amsss. 2) added further clarifications on how the proxy forwards back responses to the client ""as they come"", handling also possible multiple responses to a same group request from a same server in the group. 3) the appendix ""using oscore between client and proxy"" has been removed. at ietf 110 [3], it was agreed to have such an item separately and better defined in a separate draft, which is now available at [4] and is referred by this document. comments are very welcome!",0
"i'm bringing [link] to the list since it looks like we're (hopefully) getting close to the end game with ech. the ech draft is currently organized such that it describes all client behavior and then all server behavior. personally, i find this very confusing to follow, and i'm constantly having to flip back and forth between sections (which themselves constantly refer to each other). does anyone object to my rearranging the content to be in more of the order in which things occur rather than being divided into client and server sections? of course, depending on how i do it, it could end up being more confusing, but i just wanted to see if people were opposed to it in principle.",0

"i do not believe that the proposed changes are sufficient, and strongly object to the proposal in the cited pr request. i do fully agree with the need for an saa, and imo every deliberative body of significant importance needs such a role to maintain comity in discussions and (perhaps more importantly) keep them from going off the rails due to interpersonal disputes. however it is absolutely essential that this role be both independent of the leadership and narrowly constructed, so that the saa does not and cannot be used to marginalize people whose input the leadership wishes to suppress. i strongly believe that the saa role has been abused in the past in precisely this way, and that this has had, and may continue to have, a significant chilling effect on ietf's ability to serve as a consensus-making body for the benefit of the broader internet community. neither the ietf chair nor the iesg should be choosing saas, nor should they be setting policy for saas. i would be fine with the saas being chosen by either the iab or the nomcom. the saas should strictly follow ietf consensus as stated in bcp45 and other ietf consensus documents. the policies should be relatively unambiguous, and uniformly interpreted without prejudice for or against any individual. so the saas should not be encouraged to ""take into account the overall nature of the postings by an individual and whether particular postings are an aberration or typical"". but neither should the saas' remedies be limited to restricting posting by a person or of a thread - lesser remedies should be available so that occasional inappropriate postings can be remedied without drastic action. all saa actions (other than private feedback to an individual) should be recorded so that they are visible to the community.",-1

"with all due respect, one would expect an area director to stay away from hypothetical and conditional claims (which in this case seem to be single-source base, based on ilari liusvaara's assessments {where, in the past, these were consistently inaccurate, but nevertheless quoted}). moreover, one would expect a security area director to be able to look up some specs and read this, if this helps, and not simply declare oneself incompetent in the matter. i do think staying mum for over half a year and throwing other gratuitous spokes in the wheel is an ad-role unworthy behavior (but perhaps my standards are higher).",-1
"i simply don't consider these activities sensible given the present, fully planned and telegraphed civilizational collapse. we are currently just going through the motions while we wait for the collapse to kick in. hyperinflation is around the corner. jack dorsey tweeted as much. it's obvious to anyone who pays attention to what the federal reserve and ecb have been doing over the past 2 years, and for the past 2 decades. mass deaths are also around the corner. these will be caused by the injections. this is obvious to anyone who pays attention to the foreshadowing public statements done by the same people who predicted in 2017 and 2019 that ""a pandemic is inevitable"". klaus schwab tells you what is happening outright. you can read it in his books. people just don't pay attention because they do not realize he's the leader of the world economic forum, and this institution trained many of the politicians that we think were elected, but were actually fraudulently installed. the world, as we know it, is coming to an end. everything you thought you knew, is wrong. there will be a new world after this, but there's no way to know what it will look like, or who of us will still be part of it. there certainly appears to be a plan to remove large proportions of the world's population, and to enslave the rest in a sort-of ai-led regime. all property is to be confiscated. the coming hyperinflation is to help with this, as is the destruction of the middle class due to the lockdowns. we, the people, are in a global relationship with psychopaths. bit-fiddling does not make sense until this existential threat is defeated. and if it's not, then it's up to each individual if you want to accept the gimp suit that the globalist elite is going to make you wear.",-1
"the issue, here, is not about parsing header fields. it is about generating them. and rfc 821 specifies creation of some header fields. this also is about delivery, which is when for get created. but since you raised [link] actually, this highlights why the smtp specification should not deal with delivery issues, per se, and should leave that to an mda specification. the smtp specification gets a lot simpler if it stops trying to cover the entire range of end-to-end handling issues and just sticks to what it is actually used for. delivery has gotten far more complex than this specification does or can deal with. the 'for' clause gets into the delivery assessment issue. since it's part of the received specification, which does apply to normal relaying, perhaps just say that there must be no more than one for clause and it contains only one address. the physics of that will adequately constrain its use. indeed it is. in some cases, unless special smtp has nothing at all to do with gateway functionality. zero. trying to touch that topic, in a mail relaying protocol specification, is a problematic distraction. especially given how irrelevant and incomplete the text is to actual gatewaying behavior. i suspect it's not because of my gender, but i frequently look for the for clause. i get mail under a variety of different addresses. as do many others. so excluding that utility is problematic. i don't understand how the above paragraph is relevant to the smtp specification. mixing submission with discussion of the for clause makes no sense to me. in any event, i also don't understand what privacy problem is being claimed. the 'given' has not been clearly established here. so the premise needs some work. because it is used and it is useful. d/",-1

"the number of people who could write the same as below but substitute crh for srv6 is much bigger. because the number of srv6 installations is much bigger. if they would become proprietary then it would be even more harmful. it is exactly the essence of this 2y old dilemma: nobody sees a win-win solution. andrew, sorry, but you are not proposing it too. what you are proposing: the minority would win, the majority would lose. i do not understand why this dispute still exists. imho: it was decided by ietf at the time when srh has been promoted to rfc 8754. from that time, carriers chosen rfc believes that it is standard. it would be not fair to say to them now that ietf has changed the mind rfc 8754 is a dead end. carriers that have chosen to implement personal draft (draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr) were probably aware that it is a proprietary solution and may stay proprietary forever. the problem could potentially hang indefinitely. it would aggravate over time because more and more installations would diverge to incompatible solutions. we are losing precious time. the more time the more painful would be the decision. dear chairs, if all augments are presented (i am not positive about it) then maybe voting? for you to see who is the minority and who is the majority. not a good resolution for a technical dispute, but it is not purely technical, right? another possibility is to improve convergence: not to choose the final solution immediately, but cancel any current one from consideration then discuss only what is left. ps: it is my personal opinion. i am far from the srv6 team in huawei. just this problem is so big for the community: 240 personal drafts stuck in the queue (in different wgs) waiting for ng data plane for sr over ipv6. i could not imagine how big activity would start in the whole ietf after the data plane would be decided.",-1

"i was one of the proponents for the ""terminate the session"" option sergio mentioned, so i'm definitely up for that. i'm not against adam's proposal with respect to the json usage and the different urls, as it seems quite flexible to me: whether it's different addresses, or http headers, seems mostly semantics to me, so i'm fine either way (even though a json syntax would definitely allow for easier extensibility in the future). i'm fine with trickling as well, personally, and so see some value in allowing ice restarts to happen too. what i'm not sure about are adam's suggestion to use heartbeats for two-way communications. adam, what kind of commands are you envisaging in the server-to-client direction here? are you mostly thinking about asynchronous events of some nature, or something else too? with respect to the approach, i understand the desire to avoid long polls, but having some commands/events returned only in response to heartbeats here may lead to implementations that will poll often and aggressively to be sure they have timely information, and ""forcing"" implementations to only send heartbears at less frequent intervals may on the other end lead to suboptimal user experience (depending, again, on the nature of the commands/events the server would mean to send back). in general, though, i think the proposal looks interesting, and i'm looking forward to the session in a couple of weeks.",1
