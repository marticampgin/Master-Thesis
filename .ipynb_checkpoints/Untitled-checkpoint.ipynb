      "Ruthie Mae Bolton was born January 6, 1961, in the Hungry Neck section of Charleston, South Carolina. At the time, her mother was thirteen; she has never known who her father was. Her mother was the wandering kind, so Ruthie Mae-nicknamed \"Gal\" by her stepgrandfather-was raised in her grandparents' home. One day Grandmama died as a result of a severe beating by her husband-it occured to no one to call this to the attention of the authorities-and Gal was left in the brutal hands of her granddaddy, who beat her unmercifully as well. Ruthie Mae began to steal things in school and she developed a stutter; she drank and smoked dope. But she stuck resolutely with her education and graduated from high school, which was likely her salvation, for today Ruthie Mae is happily married, with children and a fine job. At last she is at peace-with herself and even with the memory of her grandfather. It is nigh impossible to convey the astonishingly eloquent simplicity of Ruthie Mae's witnessing to her time. Here is an absolutely remarkable document, as touching as it is painful, as ageless as it is timely.<br />\n",

      "Polanski is well known; the name of the director of <i>Knife in the Water</i>,  <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, <i>Chinatown </i>and <i>The Pianist</i>  is recognised and respected internationally.  Yet even film critics find it difficult to say what a 'Polanski film' is.  This welcome book unravels the meanings of Polanski's films, devoting each of its chapters to an important aspect: the autobiographical factor, characters and narratives, literary adaptations like <i>Tess</i> and the recent <i>Oliver Twist</i>, Polanski's use of many genres, his music, represented ideology and so on.  In so doing, it uncovers both the common elements in his films and the ambiguities and paradoxes of his cinema. Ewa Mazierska reveals the essentials of Polanski the 'cinema kid', influenced by many people and movements, but like a magpie interested in everything that he encounters, moving easily between Europe and America, between low budget and big budget endeavours.  This book is the perfect introduction to Polanski's films and at the same time delves deep into their complexities - sharing a real joy in their riches.<u></u>\n",

      "In 1987, the death of Ben Linder, the first American killed by President Reagan's \"freedom fighters\" -- the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras -- ignited a firestorm of protest and debate. In this landmark first biography of Linder, investigative journalist Joan Kruckewitt tells his story. <br />In the summer of 1983, a 23-year-old American named Ben Linder arrived in Managua with a unicycle and a newly earned degree in engineering. In 1986, Linder moved from Managua to El Cuá, a village in the Nicaraguan war zone, where he helped form a team to build a hydroplant to bring electricity to the town. He was ambushed and killed by the Contras the following year while surveying a stream for a possible hydroplant. <br />In 1993, Kruckewitt traveled to the Nicaraguan mountains to investigate Linder's death. In July 1995. she finally located and interviewed one of the men who killed Ben Linder, a story that became the basis for a New Yorker feature on Linder's death. Linder's story is a portrait of one idealist who died for his beliefs, as well as a picture of a failed foreign policy, vividly exposing the true dimensions of a war that forever marked the lives of both Nicaraguans and Americans.\n",

Guthrie, Jr., contains in its pages \"the genuine article-the Indian, the trader, the mountain man, their dress, and behavior and speech and the country and climate they lived in.\"<br /><br />On September 1, 1846, Garrard, then only seventeen years old, left Westport Landing (now Kansas City) with a caravan under the command of the famous trader Céran St. Vrain, bound for Bent's Fort (Fort William) in the southeastern part of present-day Colorado. After a lengthy visit at the fort and in a camp of the Cheyenne Indians, early in 1847 he joined the little band of volunteers recruited by William Bent to avenge the death of his brother, Governor Charles Bent of Taos, killed in a bloody but brief Mexican and Indian uprising in that New Mexican pueblo. In fact, Garrard's is the only eyewitness account we have of the trial and hanging of the \"revolutionaries\" at Taos.<br /><br />Many notable figures of the plains and mountains dot his pages: traders St. Vrain and the Bents; mountain men John L. Hatcher, Jim Beckwourth, Lucien B. Maxwell, Kit Carson, and others; various soldiery traveling to and from the outposts of the Mexican War; and explorer and writer George F. Ruxton.\n",

Granddaughter of the Chief Rabbi of Israel and daughter of a highly respected London Rabbi, she rebelled strongly and so began a desperate search to discover who she was. In a whirlwind of sex and drugs, Reva strove to leave her strict family life behind her and find her own path. When, years later, Reva decides she wants to return to her Jewish faith, she leaves London and enters a woman's yeshiva in Jerusalem. Driven by a strong yearning to return to a higher level of spirituality, she is determined to find a strictly orthodox holy man to marry and have children. So Reva begins a new life, wanting to suppress her former desires and needs, and to find her way to God. In this honest and often shocking memoir, Reva presents to us the secret world of ultra Orthodox Judaism. Fascinating insights into modern day matchmakers, ritual baths, sexual codes of conduct and Jewish practice are depicted, and Revas journey is brought to life in stunning detail.\n",

      "Is human language an evolutionary adaptation? Is linguistics a natural science? These questions have bedeviled philosophers, philologists and linguists from Plato through Chomsky. Prof. Givon suggests that the answers fall naturally within an integrated study of living organisms.In this new work, Givon points out that language operates between aspects of both complex biological design and adaptive behavior. As in biology, the whole is an adaptive compromise to competing demands. Variation is the indispensable tool of learning, change and adaptation. The contrast between innateness and input-driven emergence is an interaction between genetically-coded and behaviorally-coded experience. In enlarging the cross-disciplinary domain, the book examines the parallels between language evolution and language diachrony. Sociality, cooperation and communication are shown to be rooted in a common evolutionary source, the kin-based hunting-and-gathering society of intimates. The book pays homage to the late Joseph Greenberg and his visionary integration of functional motivation, typological diversity and diachronic change.\n",

      "As the world's economy marches toward globalization, people are debating globalization's effect on the poor in developing countries. Will the developing countries be left behind? How can they be helped? What does globalization have to offer them? Since most of the countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region are considered developing countries, the issue of these effects is especially pertinent and it formed the focus of the discussions at this conference. This publication presents some of the papers submitted at this annual conference, the fifth one focusing on developing economies in the region. The 1999 Proceedings talks about decentralization and the need to bring government closer to the people in a rapidly changing global economic environment. For developing countries to realize the power of globalization, they need to concentrate on the power of decentralization, that is, getting their citizens involved in their own development and defining their own future. The aim of these discussions and this publication is to impart the knowledge needed to turn globalization into an asset rather than a liability. To accomplish this goal, the publication focuses on three subject areas: a framework for fiscal federalism; sectoral issues; and local financing and management capacity. This publication will be of interest to academics, policymakers, and decentralization experts.\n",

There, they all fall under the spell of a great European film director named Rudolph Von Beckmann, whose secret plan is to turn a routine B western into an extraordinary film of, and so warn the world of the dictator who would destroy it.

With dark, engaging wit, Jonathan Chait reveals how these canny zealots first took over the Republican Party and then gamed the political system and the media so that once unthinkable policies -- without a shred of academic, expert, or even popular support -- now drive the political agenda, regardless of which party is in power.<br /> Why have these ideas succeeded in Washington? How did a clique of extremists gain control of American economic policy and sell short the country’s future? And why do their outlandish ideas still determine policy despite repeated electoral setbacks? Chait tells the outrageous and eye-opening story, expertly explaining just how politics and economics work in Washington. Through vivid portraits of venal politicians and pseudo-economists, with wry analyses of their bogus theories, Chait gives us the tools to understand what’s really behind economic policy debates in Washington: a riveting drama of greed and deceit.\n",

Originally a mountain man, Uncle Dick ran the gamut of wild west professions: he was a scout, hunter, trapper, trader, freighter, and rancher. He narrowly escaped death on numerous occasions and he was an avid Southern sympathizer during the Civil War. Full of humor, Uncle Dick's memoirs include a description of \"Hobnobbing with Brigham Young\" and spooky tales of headless senoritas. Truly an encyclopedia of life on the southwestern frontier.\n",

      "A New Approach to Coping This workbook provides more than 50 questions and exercises designed to empower those with physical loss and disability to better understand and accept their ongoing processes of loss and recovery. The exercises in Coping with Physical Loss and Disability were distilled from ten years of clinical social work experience with clients suffering from quadriplegia, paraplegia, amputation, cancer, severe burns, HIV/AIDs, and neuro-muscular disorders arising from accidents, injury, and disease. About the Author<br /><br />Rick Ritter, MSW, a disabled veteran and social worker, has worked with more than a hundred clients who have experienced physical loss and disability. This workbook is a distillation of the very best questions and exercises to draw the client towards re-taking control of their life. He has competed in international events for disabled athletes. Ritter was also a major contributor to \"got parts? An Insider's Guide to Managing Life Successfully with Dissociative Identity Disorder.\" He currently resides in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Series Info<br /><br />\"Coping with Physical Loss and Disability: A Workbook\" is the second book in the \"New Horizons in Therapy Series.\" This series is specifically designed to empower clients to work on their own in a therapeutic setting. As many therapists will state, it's often what the client does outside the session that can make the biggest difference in recovery. What People Are Saying<br /><br />This workbook is a very good stimulus for focusing on issues that are crucial for better coping with loss and disability. Just putting the questions with the blanks together is a great opportunity for self-reflection and might greatly help people raise their consciousness. As I believe the saying goes 'If you do not help yourself, then no one will be able to help you.'\"<br /> -Beni R. Jakob, Ph.D, Israeli Arthritis Foundation (INBAR)<br /><br />\"Ritter provides a valuable self-care plan for those suffering from the loss of physical capacity. He also shows readers how to find the mental, emotional and spiritual encouragement critical to the healing process.\" -Georgiann Baldino, Author and cancer support-group facilitator<br /><br />\"Losing one's bodily integrity or functioning ('physical loss') provokes mourning and a distorted self-image. The horror and recoil that disabilities elicit in the healthy only compound the victim's sense of deprivation and worthlessness. Though slender, the workbook is indispensable to victims of physical loss, their nearest and dearest, medical staff, and psychotherapists or grief counselors.\"<br /> -Sam Vaknin, Ph.D., author of Malignant Self Love: Narcissism Revisited<br /><br />\"Rick Ritter captures the depth of the emotional pain in the aftermath of physical loss and disability. This workbook format will surely provide a sense empowerment to those who feel helpless in these situations.\" <br /> -Rev. James W. Clifton, Ph.D., LCSW<br /><br />\"I found the workbook useful in addressing the various aspects of the physical loss. The examples given by the author are very relevant and will help the sufferer relate to similar situations. I recommend the workbook to those who are trying to heal from past traumas or to those who are trying to help their near and dear heal.\"<br /> - S.V.

      "Limb loss can occur due to trauma, infection, diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and other diseases. Lower limb amputation is relatively common and has a profound impact on a person's life, regardless of the cause. Feelings of loss and grief, difficulties in learning to walk with an artificial limb, and readjustment to an interrupted life all pose considerable challenges. Nevertheless, there are countless stories of people who have successfully overcome these problems.<br /><br />This book provides the practical knowledge needed to cope with the life changes caused by lower limb amputation. It demystifies the medical process and technical jargon by using plain, easily understandable language. The first book to combine medical, prosthetic, and psychosocial factors in one convenient volume, it covers causes and ways to prevent further amputation; surgical techniques for lower limb amputation; learning to walk with a prosthesis; unique challenges faced by children and elderly people living with an amputation; exercising and sports with a lower limb prosthesis; and much more.\n",

      "In this accessible study, Stephen Humphreys introduces the most elusive of the early caliphs, Mu'awiya ibn abi Sufyan (602-680). Throughout history, some have accused him of being the first caliph to diverge from Muhammed's model of ideal Muslim leadership whilst others credit him with uniting an empire in disarray and transforming the Caliphate into a practicable form of government. In light of this, Humphreys critically analyses his sources, and seeks to get as close as possible to a historical account of the great man.\n",

      "Before the caliphate of the 'Uthman b. 'Affan, the Muslim community had grown from strength to strength in spite of a series of major crises--the Hirah, the death of the Prophet, the Riddah wars, the assassination of 'Umar by a Persian slave. But 'Uthman's reign ended in catastrophe. His inability to manage the social and political conflicts that were now emerging among various factions within the community led to his death at the hands of Muslim rebels. The consequences of this tragic event were bitter: not only a century of civil war, but also political and religious schisms of such depth that they have not been entirely healed even now. Most medieval Muslim historians told this story in an overtly partisan manner, but al-Tabari demands more of his readers. First of all, they must decide for themselves, on the basis of highly ambigous evidence, whether 'Uthman's death was tyrannicide or murder. But, more than that, they must ask how such a thing could have happened at all; what had the Muslims done to bring about the near-destruction of their community? <p>Al-Tabari presents this challenge within a broad framework. For, even while the internal crisis that issued in 'Uthman's death was coming to a head, the wars against Byzantium and Persia continued. The first expeditions into North Africa, the conquest of Cyprus, the momentary destruction of the Byzantine fleet at the Battle of the Masts, the bloody campaigns in Armenia, the Caucasus, and Khurasan are all here, in narratives that shift constantly between hard reporting and pious legend. Muslim forces retain the offensive, but there are no more easy victories; henceforth, suffering and endurance will be the hallmarks of the hero. Most evocative in the light of 'Uthman's fate is the moving account of the murder of the last Sasanian king, Yazdagird III--a man betrayed by his nobles and subjects, but most of all by his own character.</p>\n",

Every region in the country is presented as it appeared to the first Europeans who settled or explored it. You visit a Manhattan fragrant with wildflowers and covered with forests; a Boston still teeming with beavers; a Chicago trodden by countless herds of buffalo. Your eyes feast on miles of virgin canebrake, the wild turkeys in the magnolias, and the many gorgeous birds soon to be wiped out by greedy hunters.<br />Citing scores of original journals, diaries and letters, as well as authentic Indian narratives, Mr. Bakeless reconstructs the reciprocal impact of civilized Europeans and the untamed new land. He shows you what it was really like to taste the rich new fruit and game; to hunt squirrels with the backwoodsmen; to survive prairie fires and Indian onslaughts. You join the great explorers on their epoch-making treks: Coronado, viewing the first buffalo stampede seen by white men; Cartier, tasting tobacco 50 years before Raleigh was to introduce it to Europe; Radisson, enduring torture in an Indian village. But not only the great names are included here; there are also the farmers and the trappers; the simple soldiers who first caught sight of San Francisco Bay; and the man who crossed the wilds of Kentucky 100 years before Daniel Boone.<br />Sixty-eight illustrations, 39 of them specially selected for this edition, include a sketch of Niagara Falls in 1678; three now extinct American birds; a view of St. Augustine, Florida, in 1586; five of Catlin's famous Indian and buffalo scenes; and much more. The frontispiece map shows the routes of 15 major explorations from Verrazano in 1524 to Lewis and Clark in 1805.<br />Historians, students, naturalists, conservationists, anthropologists, and general readers will all enjoy and profit by this unusual re-visualization of America's fascinating past ... an incomparable recreation of a time and place that will not come again.\n",

      "In the tradition of <i>Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother of God</i>, this lavish, full-color book combines revealing text, exquisite reproductions of traditional art, and striking contemporary photographs in an unparalleled glimpse behind monastic walls. <i>Monastery</i> provides an informative, fascinating account of the ancient roots of the monastic way of life; its flowering during the Middle Ages, when the principles and elements of spirituality scattered through the works of the Church Fathers were gathered together by the first great founders; and a compelling look at the continuing traditions and realities of cloistered life today.<br /><br />M. Basil Pennington, a monk of the Cistercian order (popularly known as the Trappists), explores the monastery's physical environment and the guiding principles of prayer, worship, contemplation, work, and community life. He discusses the spirituality of the Western monastic tradition as it grew from St. Benedict of Nursia, came to full maturity with the Cistercian Fathers in the twelfth century, and was revitalized in subsequent reforms.<br /><br />Nicholas Sapieha's rare photographs from monasteries throughout the world show the diversity and validity of this often hidden way of life. His evocative images of monastic life today are matched with depictions of centuries-old monastic activities in splendid reproductions from the famed Scala archives in Florence. Together with Father Basil's sensitive text, this striking visual dimension conveys the continuity of the contemplative ideal through the centuries. <br /><br /><i>Monastery</i> does not stop with mere surface appreciation of ancient and modern monasteries throughout the world: author and photographer deeply explore the <i>experience</i> of life in these communities.<br /><br />[Description from the front flap]\n",
