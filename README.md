## Repository for Master Thesis "Evaluating Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis on IETF data".

Each folder contains Python (.py) or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files with the code for each corresponding experiment conducted in the thesis. 

[baseline_benchmarking](https://github.com/marticampgin/Master-Thesis/tree/main/baseline_benchmarking) contains .ipynb files with the code for initiating, training, and saving benchmark-models SVM and RNN. RNN from the experiments is also saved as a PyTorch (.pt) model.
