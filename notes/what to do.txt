Text Analytics in context of sentiment analysis:

Compare against vocabularies of positive/negative word collections.

Check in what context (concordance they appear).

Whether keywords (the most used words appear in context of positive/negative words).

Potentially exploire word embeddings (perform clustering to potentially see what wgs / threads are closer to each other).

Topic modelling? Sentiment in those topics? NER?

Explore n-grams as well. That could result in discovering most talked about topics or something like that.

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OVER TIME
EXPLORE WG SIMILARITY (I GUESS WE WILL NEED TO EMBEDD EVERYTHING FIRST, THEN COMPARE, OR USE SOME KIND OF ALGORITHM)
